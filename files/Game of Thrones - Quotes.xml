		<quotetext>Even in the streets, it&apos;s too damn hot for wool or fur, so they go around in these short gowns, silk if they have the silver and cotton if not, but it’s all the same when they start sweating and the cloth sticks to their skin, they might as well be naked.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Only a carved wooden box, left on a table in my observatory while I napped.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>584</paragraph>

		<quoteindex>876</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My servants saw no one, but it must have been brought by someone in the king&apos;s party.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>I asked the same question.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Clearly there was more to this than the seeming.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Indeed it is.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>The very thing I asked myself.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>592</paragraph>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>889</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I found the true message concealed within a false bottom when I dismantled the box the lens had come in, but it is not for my eyes.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Lord Baelish once, ah.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1563</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2444</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He was my father&apos;s ward.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1564</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2445</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We grew up together in Riverrun.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1564</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2446</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I thought of him as a brother, but his feelings for me were… more than brotherly.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1564</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2447</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>When it was announced that I was to wed Brandon Stark, Petyr challenged for the right to my hand.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1564</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2448</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It was madness.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1564</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2449</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Brandon was twenty, Petyr scarcely fifteen.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1564</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2450</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I had to beg Brandon to spare Petyr&apos;s life.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1564</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2451</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He let him off with a scar.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1564</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2452</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Afterward my father sent him away.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1564</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2453</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have not seen him since.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1564</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2454</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He wrote to me at Riverrun after Brandon was killed, but I burned the letter unread.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1564</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2455</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>By then I knew that Ned would marry me in his brother&apos;s place.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2457</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I knew he would rise high.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1566</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2458</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He was always clever, even as a boy, but it is one thing to be clever and another to be wise.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1566</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2459</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I wonder what the years have done to him.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>My lady.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1574</paragraph>

		<quoteindex>2461</quoteindex>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2462</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You must not enter the castle.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1574</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2463</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I will go in your stead and bring Ser Aron to you in some safe place.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1574</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2464</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You would be as much at risk as I would.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1575</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2465</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I think not.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1576</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2466</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I looked at my reflection in the water earlier and scarcely recognized myself.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1576</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2467</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My mother was the last person to see me without whiskers, and she is forty years dead.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1576</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2468</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I believe I am safe enough, my lady.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1576</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2469</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>King&apos;s Landing, my lady, as you did command, and never has a ship made a swifter or surer passage.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1577</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2470</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Will you be needing assistance to carry your things to the castle?</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1577</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2471</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We shall not be going to the castle.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1578</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2472</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Perhaps you can suggest an inn, someplace clean and comfortable and not too far from the river.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1578</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2473</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Just so.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1579</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2474</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I know of several establishments that might suit your needs.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1579</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2475</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yet first, if I may be so bold, there is the matter of the second half of the payment we agreed upon.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1579</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2476</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And of course the extra silver you were so kind as to promise.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1579</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2477</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Sixty stags, I believe it was.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1579</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2478</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>For the oarmen.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1580</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2479</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, of a certainty.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1581</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2480</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Though perhaps I should hold it for them until we return to Tyrosh.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1581</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2481</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>For the sake of their wives and children.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1581</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2482</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If you give them the silver here, my lady, they will dice it away or spend it all for a night&apos;s pleasure.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1581</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2483</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There are worse things to spend money on.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1582</paragraph>

		<quotetext>Winter is coming.</quotetext>

		<paragraph>1583</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2486</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They earned the silver.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1583</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2487</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How they spend it is no concern of mine.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1583</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2488</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>As you say, my lady.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1584</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2489</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I think it best if you stay away from the common room.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1586</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2490</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Even in a place like this, one never knows who may be watching.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1586</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2491</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I will be back before nightfall, with Ser Aron.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1586</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2492</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Rest now, my lady.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1586</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2493</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Open, in the name of the king.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1589</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2494</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A moment.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1590</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2495</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No need for that, m&apos;lady.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1591</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2496</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We&apos;re to escort you to the castle.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1591</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2497</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>By whose authority?</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2508</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your hands.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1601</paragraph>

		<quoteindex>2515</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He will be joining us shortly, but I wanted to see you alone first.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>How many years?</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1605</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2518</quoteindex>

		<paragraph>1606</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2519</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You don&apos;t want to call him that.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1607</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2520</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He&apos;s very sensitive.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1607</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2521</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Comes of being an eunuch, I imagine.</quotetext>

		<paragraph>1607</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2523</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oftimes he knows about it before it happens.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1607</paragraph>

		<quoteindex>2524</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He has informants everywhere.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>His little birds, he calls them.</quotetext>

		<paragraph>1607</paragraph>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2527</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Thankfully, Varys came to me first.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Why you?</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2890</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>so it falls to us to govern the realm.</quotetext>

		<paragraph>1793</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2896</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>is that His Grace instructs us to stage a great tournament in honor of his appointment as the Hand of the King.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1793</paragraph>

		<quotetext>Just what it appears.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1838</paragraph>

		<paragraph>1839</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2995</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This blade was sent to open Bran&apos;s throat and spill his life’s blood.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1840</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2996</quoteindex>

		<quoteindex>3005</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If the queen had a role in this or, gods forbid, the king himself… no, I will not believe that.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1846</paragraph>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3006</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Most likely the king did not know.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1847</paragraph>

		<paragraph>1849</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3011</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The queen… if you can find proof, and if you can make Robert listen, then perhaps.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1849</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3012</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We have proof.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1850</paragraph>

		<quotetext>We have the dagger.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>This?</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1851</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3015</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A sweet piece of steel, but it cuts two ways, my lord.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1851</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3016</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Imp will no doubt swear the blade was lost or stolen while he was at Winterfell, and with his hireling dead, who is there to give him the lie?</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1851</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3017</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My counsel is to drop that in the river and forget that it was ever forged.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1851</paragraph>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3018</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Baelish, I am a Stark of Winterfell.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1852</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3019</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My son lies crippled, perhaps dying.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1852</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3020</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He would be dead, and Catelyn with him, but for a wolf pup we found in the snow.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1852</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3021</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If you truly believe I could forget that, you are as big a fool now as when you took up sword against my brother.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1852</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3022</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A fool I may be, Stark… yet I&apos;m still here, while your brother has been moldering in his frozen grave for some fourteen years now.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1853</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3023</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If you are so eager to molder beside him, far be it from me to dissuade you, but I would rather not be included in the party, thank you very much.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1853</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3024</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You would be the last man I would willingly include in any party, Lord Baelish.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1854</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3025</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You wound me deeply.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1855</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3026</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>For my part, I always found you Starks a tiresome lot, but Cat seems to have become attached to you, for reasons I cannot comprehend.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1855</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3027</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I shall try to keep you alive for her sake.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1855</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3028</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A fool&apos;s task, admittedly, but I could never refuse your wife anything.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1855</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3029</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I told Petyr our suspicions about Jon Arryn&apos;s death.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1856</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>Very well.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1857</paragraph>

		<quotetext>You spoke of Varys.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1857</paragraph>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3033</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Does the eunuch know all of it?</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1857</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3034</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Not from my lips.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1858</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3035</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You did not wed a fool, Eddard Stark.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1858</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3036</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But Varys has ways of learning things that no man could know.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1858</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3037</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He has some dark art, Ned, I swear it.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1858</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3038</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He has spies, that is well known.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1859</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3039</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It is more than that.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1860</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3040</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ser Rodrik spoke to Ser Aron Santagar in all secrecy, yet somehow the Spider knew of their conversation.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1860</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3041</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I fear that man.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1860</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3042</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Leave Lord Varys to me, sweet lady.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1861</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3043</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If you will permit me a small obscenity—and where better for it—I hold the man&apos;s balls in the palm of my hand.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1861</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3044</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Or would, if he were a man, or had any balls.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1861</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3045</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You see, if the pie is opened, the birds begin to sing, and Varys would not like that.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1861</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3046</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Were I you, I would worry more about the Lannisters and less about the eunuch.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>1861</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3047</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My lady.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>That would be most unwise.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>The Red Keep is full of curious eyes, and children talk.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>As you say, my lord.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>3670</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Fear is for the long night, when the sun hides its face for years at a time, and little children are born and live and die all in darkness while the direwolves grow gaunt and hungry, and the white walkers move through the woods.</quotetext>

		<paragraph>2186</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3674</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There came a night that lasted a generation, and kings shivered and died in their castles even as the swineherds in their hovels.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Well.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2187</paragraph>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3679</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>yes, only.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2187</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3680</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>In that darkness, the Others came for the first time.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2188</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3681</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They were cold things, dead things, that hated iron and fire and the touch of the sun, and every creature with hot blood in its veins.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2188</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3682</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They swept over holdfasts and cities and kingdoms, felled heroes and armies by the score, riding their pale dead horses and leading hosts of the slain.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2188</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3683</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>All the swords of men could not stay their advance, and even maidens and suckling babes found no pity in them.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2188</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3684</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They hunted the maids through frozen forests, and fed their dead servants on the flesh of human children.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2188</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3685</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Now these were the days before the Andals came, and long before the women fled across the narrow sea from the cities of the Rhoyne, and the hundred kingdoms of those times were the kingdoms of the First Men, who had taken these lands from the children of the forest.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2190</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3686</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yet here and there in the fastness of the woods the children still lived in their wooden cities and hollow hills, and the faces in the trees kept watch.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2190</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3687</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So as cold and death filled the earth, the last hero determined to seek out the children, in the hopes that their ancient magics could win back what the armies of men had lost.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2190</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3688</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He set out into the dead lands with a sword, a horse, a dog, and a dozen companions.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2190</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3689</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>For years he searched, until he despaired of ever finding the children of the forest in their secret cities.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2190</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3690</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>One by one his friends died, and his horse, and finally even his dog, and his sword froze so hard the blade snapped when he tried to use it.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2190</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3691</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And the Others smelled the hot blood in him, and came silent on his trail, stalking him with packs of pale white spiders big as hounds.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>You asked about Lord Arryn.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2269</paragraph>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3861</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I did.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2270</paragraph>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3862</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If truth be told, the Hand had not seemed quite himself for some time.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2271</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3863</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We had sat together on council many a year, he and I, and the signs were there to read, but I put them down to the great burdens he had borne so faithfully for so long.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2271</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3864</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Those broad shoulders were weighed down by all the cares of the realm, and more besides.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2271</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3865</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>His son was ever sickly, and his lady wife so anxious that she would scarcely let the boy out of her sight.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2271</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3866</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It was enough to weary even a strong man, and the Lord Jon was not young.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2271</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3867</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Small wonder if he seemed melancholy and tired.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2271</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3868</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Or so I thought at the time.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2271</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3869</quoteindex>

		<quotetext>What can you tell me of his final illness?</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2272</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3871</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He came to me one day asking after a certain book, as hale and healthy as ever, though it did seem to me that something was troubling him deeply.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2273</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3872</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The next morning he was twisted over in pain, too sick to rise from bed.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2273</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3873</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Maester Colemon thought it was a chill on the stomach.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2273</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3874</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The weather had been hot, and the Hand often iced his wine, which can upset the digestion.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2273</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3875</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>When Lord Jon continued to weaken, I went to him myself, but the gods did not grant me the power to save him.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2273</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3876</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have heard that you sent Maester Colemon away.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2274</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3877</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I did, and I fear the Lady Lysa will never forgive me that.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2275</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3878</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Maybe I was wrong, but at the time I thought it best.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2275</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3879</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Maester Colemon is like a son to me, and I yield to none in my esteem for his abilities, but he is young, and the young ofttimes do not comprehend the frailty of an older body.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2275</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3880</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He was purging Lord Arryn with wasting potions and pepper juice, and I feared he might kill him.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2275</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3881</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Did Lord Arryn say anything to you during his final hours?</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2276</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3882</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>In the last stage of his fever, the Hand called out the name Robert several times, but whether he was asking for his son or for the king I could not say.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2277</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3883</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lady Lysa would not permit the boy to enter the sickroom, for fear that he too might be taken ill.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2277</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3884</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The king did come, and he sat beside the bed for hours, talking and joking of times long past in hopes of raising Lord Jon&apos;s spirits.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2277</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3885</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>His love was fierce to see.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2277</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3886</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Was there nothing else?</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2278</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3887</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No final words?</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2278</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3888</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>When I saw that all hope had fled, I gave the Hand the milk of the poppy, so he should not suffer.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2279</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3889</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Just before he closed his eyes for the last time, he whispered something to the king and his lady wife, a blessing for his son.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2279</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3890</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The seed is strong, he said.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2279</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3891</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>At the end, his speech was too slurred to comprehend.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2279</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3892</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Death did not come until the next morning, but Lord Jon was at peace after that.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2279</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3893</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He never spoke again.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2279</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3894</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Did it seem to you that there was anything unnatural about Lord Arryn&apos;s death?</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2280</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3895</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Unnatural?</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2281</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3896</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No, I could not say so.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2281</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3897</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Sad, for a certainty.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2281</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3898</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yet in its own way, death is the most natural thing of all, Lord Eddard.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2281</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3899</quoteindex>

		<quotetext>Lord Jon&apos;s death was no stranger than any other.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2283</paragraph>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3907</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>His wife thought otherwise.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>If an old man may be forgiven his blunt speech, let me say that grief can derange even the strongest and most disciplined of minds, and the Lady Lysa was never that.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>3910</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Since her last stillbirth, she has seen enemies in every shadow, and the death of her lord husband left her shattered and lost.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Poison.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2288</paragraph>

		<quotetext>Grand Maester Aethelmure wrote that all men carry murder in their hearts, yet even so, the poisoner is beneath contempt.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>What you suggest is possible, my lord, yet I do not think it likely.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2289</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3919</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Every hedge maester knows the common poisons, and Lord Arryn displayed none of the signs.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2289</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3920</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And the Hand was loved by all.</quotetext>

	<quote>

		<quotetext>Such a strong boy.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2536</paragraph>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4387</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Those hands of his, those hands were made for hammers.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2536</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4388</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He had such promise, I took him on without a fee.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2536</paragraph>

		<quoteindex>4389</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The truth now.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2537</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4390</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The streets are full of strong boys.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>4391</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The day you take on an apprentice without a fee will be the day the Wall comes down.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2537</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4392</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Who paid for him?</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2537</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4393</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A lord.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2538</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4394</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He gave no name, and wore no sigil on his coat.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2538</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4395</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He paid in gold, twice the customary sum, and said he was paying once for the boy, and once for my silence.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2538</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4396</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Describe him.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2539</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4397</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He was stout, round of shoulder, not so tall as you.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2540</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4398</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Brown beard, but there was a bit of red in it, I&apos;ll swear.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2540</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4399</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He wore a rich cloak, that I do remember, heavy purple velvet worked with silver threads, but the hood shadowed his face and I never did see him clear.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2540</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4400</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My lord, I want no trouble.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2540</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4401</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>None of us wants trouble, but I fear these are troubled times, Master Mott.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2541</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4402</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You know who the boy is.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2541</paragraph>

		<quoteindex>4403</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I am only an armorer, my lord.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4406</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That is not a question.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2543</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4407</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The boy is my apprentice.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2544</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4408</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Who he was before he came to me, that&apos;s none of my concern.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2544</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4409</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If the day ever comes when Gendry would rather wield a sword than forge one, send him to me.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2545</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4410</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He has the look of a warrior.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2545</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4411</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Until then, you have my thanks, Master Mott, and my promise.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>2545</paragraph>

		<quoteindex>4412</quoteindex>

		<paragraph>3867</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6851</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>To ask that Samwell Tarly be taken from training and accepted as a brother of the Night&apos;s Watch.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>3868</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6852</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This is no concern of Maester Aemon.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>3869</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6853</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Our Lord Commander has given the training of recruits into the hands of Ser Alliser Thorne.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>3870</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6854</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Only he may say when a boy is ready to swear his vow, as you surely know.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>3870</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6855</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why then come to me?</quotetext>

		<quotetext>The Lord Commander listens to you.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>3871</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6857</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And the wounded and the sick of the Night&apos;s Watch are in your charge.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>3871</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6858</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And is your friend Samwell wounded or sick?</quotetext>
		<paragraph>3872</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6859</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He will be.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>3873</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6860</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>unless you help.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>3873</paragraph>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6861</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Without us to keep him safe, Sam will have no chance.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>3874</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6862</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He&apos;s hopeless with a sword.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>3874</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6863</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My sister Arya could tear him apart, and she&apos;s not yet ten.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>3874</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6864</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If Ser Alliser makes him fight, it&apos;s only a matter of time before he’s hurt or killed.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>3874</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6865</quoteindex>

		<paragraph>3875</paragraph>

		<quotetext>He is a pig, and a hopeless craven as well, if what you say is true.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>3875</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6867</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Maybe it is so.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>3876</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6868</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Tell me, Chett, what would you have us do with such a boy?</quotetext>
		<paragraph>3876</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6869</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Leave him where he is.</quotetext>

		<paragraph>3877</paragraph>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6871</quoteindex>

		<paragraph>3877</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6872</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ser Alliser shall make a man of him or kill him, as the gods will.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>3877</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6873</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That&apos;s stupid.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>3878</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6874</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I remember once I asked Maester Luwin why he wore a chain around his throat.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>3878</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6875</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Go on.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>3879</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6876</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He told me that a maester&apos;s collar is made of chain to remind him that he is sworn to serve.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>3880</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6877</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I asked why each link was a different metal.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>3880</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6878</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A silver chain would look much finer with his grey robes, I said.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>3880</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6879</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Maester Luwin laughed.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>3880</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6880</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A maester forges his chain with study, he told me.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>3880</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6881</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The different metals are each a different kind of learning, gold for the study of money and accounts, silver for healing, iron for warcraft.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>3880</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6882</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And he said there were other meanings as well.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>3880</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6883</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The collar is supposed to remind a maester of the realm he serves, isn&apos;t that so?</quotetext>
		<paragraph>3880</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6884</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lords are gold and knights steel, but two links can&apos;t make a chain.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>3880</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6885</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You also need silver and iron and lead, tin and copper and bronze and all the rest, and those are farmers and smiths and merchants and the like.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>3880</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6886</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A chain needs all sorts of metals, and a land needs all sorts of people.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>3880</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6887</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And so?</quotetext>
		<paragraph>3881</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6888</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Night&apos;s Watch needs all sorts too.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Lord Randyll couldn&apos;t make Sam a warrior, and Ser Alliser won’t either.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>You can&apos;t hammer tin into iron, no matter how hard you beat it, but that doesn’t mean tin is useless.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6892</quoteindex>

		<quotetext>No one else.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Not his steward, nor the captain of his guard, nor his lady wife, but only Lord Stannis himself.</quotetext>

		<paragraph>4400</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7975</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I know.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4401</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7976</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I also know that Robert has named you Protector of the Realm.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4401</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7977</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And how is it you know that, my lord?</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4402</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7978</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Varys hinted as much.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4403</paragraph>

		<quotetext>No.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>7987</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I know the secret Jon Arryn was murdered to protect.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4406</paragraph>

		<quotetext>Joffrey and Tommen are Jaime Lannister&apos;s bastards, born of his incestuous union with the queen.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4406</paragraph>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7990</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Shocking.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4407</paragraph>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7991</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The girl as well?</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4407</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7992</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No doubt.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4407</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7993</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So when the king dies.</quotetext>

	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7994</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The throne by rights passes to Lord Stannis, the elder of Robert&apos;s two brothers.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4408</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7995</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So it would seem.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4409</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7996</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Unless.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4409</paragraph>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7997</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Unless, my lord?</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4410</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7998</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There is no seeming to this.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4410</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7999</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Stannis is the heir.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4410</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8000</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Nothing can change that.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4410</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8001</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Stannis cannot take the throne without your help.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4411</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8002</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If you&apos;re wise, you’ll make certain Joffrey succeeds.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8003</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Have you no shred of honor?</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Oh, a shred, surely.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4413</paragraph>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8005</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Now look at the other side of the coin.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4414</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8006</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Joffrey is but twelve, and Robert gave you the regency, my lord.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4414</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8007</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You are the Hand of the King and Protector of the Realm.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4414</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8008</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The power is yours, Lord Stark.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4414</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8009</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>All you need do is reach out and take it.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4414</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8010</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Make your peace with the Lannisters.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4414</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8011</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Release the Imp.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4414</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8012</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Wed Joffrey to your Sansa.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4414</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8013</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Wed your younger girl to Prince Tommen, and your heir to Myrcella.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4414</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8014</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It will be four years before Joffrey comes of age.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4414</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8015</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>By then he will look to you as a second father, and if not, well… four years is a good long while, my lord.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4414</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8016</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Long enough to dispose of Lord Stannis.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4414</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8017</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Then, should Joffrey prove troublesome, we can reveal his little secret and put Lord Renly on the throne.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4414</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8018</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We?</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4415</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8019</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;ll need someone to share your burdens.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4416</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8020</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I assure you, my price would be modest.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4416</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8021</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your price.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4417</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8022</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Baelish, what you suggest is treason.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4417</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8023</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Only if we lose.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4418</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8024</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You forget.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4419</paragraph>

		<quotetext>You forget Jon Arryn.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4419</paragraph>

		<quoteindex>8026</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You forget Jory Cassel.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4419</paragraph>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8027</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And you forget this.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4419</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8028</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They sent a man to cut my son&apos;s throat, Lord Baelish.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4419</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8029</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I fear I did forget, my lord.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>8030</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Pray forgive me.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4420</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8031</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>For a moment I did not remember that I was talking to a Stark.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4420</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8032</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So it will be Stannis, and war?</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4420</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8033</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It is not a choice.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4421</paragraph>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8034</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Stannis is the heir.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4421</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8035</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Far be it from me to dispute the Lord Protector.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4422</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8036</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What would you have of me, then?</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4422</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8037</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Not my wisdom, for a certainty.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4422</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8038</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I shall do my best to forget your… wisdom.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4423</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8039</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I called you here to ask for the help you promised Catelyn.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4423</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8040</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This is a perilous hour for all of us.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4423</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8041</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Robert has named me Protector, true enough, but in the eyes of the world, Joffrey is still his son and heir.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4423</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8042</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The queen has a dozen knights and a hundred men-at-arms who will do whatever she commands… enough to overwhelm what remains of my own household guard.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4423</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8043</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And for all I know, her brother Jaime may be riding for King&apos;s Landing even as we speak, with a Lannister host at his back.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4423</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8044</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And you without an army.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4424</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8045</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There is small love lost between Lord Renly and the Lannisters.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8046</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Bronze Yohn Royce, Ser Balon Swann, Ser Loras, Lady Tanda, the Redwyne twins… each of them has a retinue of knights and sworn swords here at court.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4424</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8047</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Renly has thirty men in his personal guard, the rest even fewer.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4425</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8048</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It is not enough, even if I could be certain that all of them will choose to give me their allegiance.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8049</quoteindex>

		<quotetext>Ah, but when the queen proclaims one king and the Hand another, whose peace do they protect?</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4426</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8052</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why, there&apos;s your answer.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>They follow the man who pays them.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>You wear your honor like a suit of armor, Stark.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4426</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8055</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You think it keeps you safe, but all it does is weigh you down and make it hard for you to move.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4426</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8056</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Look at you now.</quotetext>

	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8059</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You know it has to be done… but it&apos;s not honorable, so the words stick in your throat.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4426</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8060</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I ought to make you say it, but that would be cruel… so have no fear, my good lord.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>4428</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8061</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>For the sake of the love I bear for Catelyn, I will go to Janos Slynt this very hour and make certain that the City Watch is yours.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>9165</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Roose Bolton, Rickard Karstark, Galbart and Robett Glover, the Greatjon, Helman Tallhart… you might have given the command to any of them.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9166</quoteindex>

		<quotetext>Someday these lords will look to you as their liege.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>5106</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9177</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If I pack you off now, like a child being sent to bed without his supper, they will remember, and laugh about it in their cups.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>5106</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9178</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The day will come when you need them to respect you, even fear you a little.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Yes.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Lord Manderly told me when I landed at White Harbor.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>5110</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9187</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Have you had any word of your sisters?</quotetext>
		<paragraph>5110</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9188</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There was a letter.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>5111</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9189</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>One for you as well, but it came to Winterfell with mine.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>5111</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9190</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This is the one she wrote me, I never thought to bring yours.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>5111</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9191</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This is Cersei&apos;s letter, not your sister’s.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>5112</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9192</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The real message is in what Sansa does not say.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>5112</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9193</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>All this about how kindly and gently the Lannisters are treating her… I know the sound of a threat, even whispered.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>5112</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9194</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They have Sansa hostage, and they mean to keep her.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>5112</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9195</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There&apos;s no mention of Arya.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>5113</paragraph>

		<quotetext>No.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>5114</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9197</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I had hoped… if you still held the Imp, a trade of hostages.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>5115</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9198</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Is there word from the Eyrie?</quotetext>
		<paragraph>5115</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9199</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I wrote to Aunt Lysa, asking help.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>5115</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9200</quoteindex>

		<paragraph>5115</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9201</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Will the knights of the Vale come join us?</quotetext>
		<paragraph>5115</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9202</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Only one.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>5116</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9203</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>the best of them, my uncle… but Brynden Blackfish was a Tully first.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>5116</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9204</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My sister is not about to stir beyond her Bloody Gate.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Mother, what are we going to do?</quotetext>
		<paragraph>5117</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9206</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I brought this whole army together, eighteen thousand men, but I don&apos;t… I’m not certain.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>5117</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9207</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What are you so afraid of, Robb?</quotetext>
		<paragraph>5119</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9208</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>5120</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9209</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If we march… even if we win… the Lannisters hold Sansa, and Father.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>5120</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9210</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They&apos;ll kill them, won’t they?</quotetext>
		<paragraph>5120</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9211</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They want us to think so.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>5121</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9212</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You mean they&apos;re lying?</quotetext>
		<paragraph>5122</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9213</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I do not know, Robb.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>5123</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9214</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What I do know is that you have no choice.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>5123</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9215</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If you go to King&apos;s Landing and swear fealty, you will never be allowed to leave.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>5123</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9216</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If you turn your tail and retreat to Winterfell, your lords will lose all respect for you.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>5123</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9217</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Some may even go over to the Lannisters.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>5123</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9218</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Then the queen, with that much less to fear, can do as she likes with her prisoners.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>5123</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9219</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Our best hope, our only true hope, is that you can defeat the foe in the field.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>5123</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9220</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If you should chance to take Lord Tywin or the Kingslayer captive, why then a trade might very well be possible, but that is not the heart of it.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>5123</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9221</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So long as you have power enough that they must fear you, Ned and your sister should be safe.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>5123</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9222</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Cersei is wise enough to know that she may need them to make her peace, should the fighting go against her.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>5123</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9223</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What if the fighting doesn&apos;t go against her?</quotetext>
		<paragraph>5124</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9224</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What if it goes against us?</quotetext>
		<paragraph>5124</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9225</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Robb, I will not soften the truth for you.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>5125</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9226</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If you lose, there is no hope for any of us.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>9228</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Remember the fate of Rhaegar&apos;s children.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>5125</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9229</quoteindex>

		<quotetext>Tell me what you know of the fighting in the riverlands.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>5127</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9231</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Less than a fortnight past, they fought a battle in the hills below the Golden Tooth.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>5128</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9232</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Father must have known that, because he sent out some men to oppose them, under the king&apos;s own banner.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>5129</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9233</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He gave the command to some southron lordling, Lord Erik or Derik or something like that, but Ser Raymun Darry rode with him, and the letter said there were other knights as well, and a force of Father&apos;s own guardsmen.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>5129</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9234</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Only it was a trap.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>5129</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9235</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Derik had no sooner crossed the Red Fork than the Lannisters fell upon him, the king&apos;s banner be damned, and Gregor Clegane took them in the rear as they tried to pull back across the Mummer’s Ford.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>5129</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9236</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This Lord Derik and a few others may have escaped, no one is certain, but Ser Raymun was killed, and most of our men from Winterfell.</quotetext>

	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9237</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Tywin has closed off the kingsroad, it&apos;s said, and now he’s marching north toward Harrenhal, burning as he goes.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>5129</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9238</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You mean to meet him here?</quotetext>
		<paragraph>5130</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9239</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If he comes so far, but no one thinks he will.</quotetext>

	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9240</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ve sent word to Howland Reed, Father’s old friend at Greywater Watch.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>5131</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9241</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If the Lannisters come up the Neck, the crannogmen will bleed them every step of the way, but Galbart Glover says Lord Tywin is too smart for that, and Roose Bolton agrees.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>5131</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9242</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He&apos;ll stay close to the Trident, they believe, taking the castles of the river lords one by one, until Riverrun stands alone.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>5131</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9243</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We need to march south to meet him.</quotetext>

	<quote>

		<quotetext>Is that wise?</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>9247</quoteindex>

		<quotetext>Both plans have virtues, but… look, if we try to swing around Lord Tywin&apos;s host, we take the risk of being caught between him and the Kingslayer, and if we attack him… by all reports, he has more men than I do, and a lot more armored horse.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9964</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ll match him son for son, and I’ll still have nineteen and a half left when all of his are dead!</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>9976</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I proposed that Lord and Lady Arryn foster two of my grandsons at court, and offered to take their own son to ward here at the Twins.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>5501</paragraph>

		<quotetext>Walder is Merrett&apos;s son, named after me, and the other one… heh, I don’t recall… he might have been another Walder, they’re always naming them Walder so I’ll favor them, but his father… which one was his father now?</quotetext>
		<paragraph>5501</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9980</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well, whoever he was, Lord Arryn wouldn&apos;t have him, or the other one, and I blame your lady sister for that.</quotetext>
		<paragraph>5501</paragraph>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9981</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She frosted up as if I&apos;d suggested selling her boy to a mummer’s show or making a eunuch out of him, and when Lord Arryn said the child was going to Dragonstone to foster with Stannis Baratheon, she stormed off without a word of regrets and all the Hand could give me was apologies.</quotetext>
