		<quotetext>One man had an axe.</quotetext>

	<quote>

		<quotetext>Heavy-looking, double-bladed, a cruel piece of iron.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>46</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It was on the ground beside him, right by his hand.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>What do you think might have killed these men, Gared?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>61</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It was the cold,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>62</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I saw men freeze last winter, and the one before, when I was half a boy.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>63</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Everyone talks about snows forty foot deep, and how the ice wind comes howling out of the north, but the real enemy is the cold.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>64</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It steals up on you quieter than Will, and at first you shiver and your teeth chatter and you stamp your feet and dream of mulled wine and nice hot fires.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>65</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It burns, it does.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>66</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Nothing burns like the cold.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>67</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But only for a while.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>68</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Then it gets inside you and starts to fill you up, and after a while you don&apos;t have the strength to fight it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>69</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s easier just to sit down or go to sleep.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>70</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They say you don&apos;t feel any pain toward the end.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>71</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>First you go weak and drowsy, and everything starts to fade, and then it&apos;s like sinking into a sea of warm milk.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>72</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Peaceful, like.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>73</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Such eloquence, Gared,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>74</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I never suspected you had it in you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>75</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ve had the cold in me too, lordling.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>76</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Two ears, three toes, and the little finger off my left hand.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>77</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I got off light.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>78</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We found my brother frozen at his watch, with a smile on his face.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>79</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You ought dress more warmly, Gared.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>80</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We&apos;ll see how warm you can dress when the winter comes.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>81</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If Gared said it was the coldâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>82</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Have you drawn any watches this past week, Will?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>83</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes, m&apos;lord.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>84</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And how did you find the Wall?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>85</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Weeping,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>86</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They couldn&apos;t have froze.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>87</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Not if the Wall was weeping.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>88</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It wasn&apos;t cold enough.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>89</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Bright lad.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>90</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We&apos;ve had a few light frosts this past week, and a quick flurry of snow now and then, but surely no cold fierce enough to kill eight grown men.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>91</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Men clad in fur and leather, let me remind you, with shelter near at hand, and the means of making fire.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>92</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Will, lead us there.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>93</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I would see these dead men for myself.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>94</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We can make a better pace than this, surely,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>95</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Not with this horse,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>96</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Perhaps my lord would care to take the lead?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>97</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why are you stopping?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>98</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Best go the rest of the way on foot, m&apos;lord.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>99</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s just over that ridge.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Listen to the darkness.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>105</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Trees rustling.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>106</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A wolf.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>107</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Which sound is it that unmans you so, Gared?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>108</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The trees press close here,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>109</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That sword will tangle you up, m&apos;lord.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>110</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Better a knife.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>You could see it in his eyes, Stark.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Maybe she didn&apos;t,</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>234</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You have five trueborn children,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Three sons, two daughters.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>The direwolf is the sigil of your House.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>237</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your children were meant to have these pups, my lord.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>You want no pup for yourself, Jon?</quotetext>

		<quotetext>I am no Stark, Father.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>241</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I will nurse him myself, Father,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>242</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I will soak a towel with warm milk, and give him suck from that.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>243</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Me too!</quotetext>

	<quote>

		<quotetext>The kennelmaster will have nothing to do with these monsters, I promise you that.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>And the gods help you if you neglect them, or brutalize them, or train them badly.</quotetext>

	<quote>

		<quotetext>These are not dogs to beg for treats and slink off at a kick.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>276</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>In the kitchen, arguing about names for the wolf pups.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>277</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Arya is already in love, and Sansa is charmed and gracious, but Rickon is not quite sure.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>278</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Is he afraid?</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>279</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A little,</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>280</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He is only three.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>He must learn to face his fears.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>The poor man was half-mad.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Is this news certain?</quotetext>

		<quotetext>It was the king&apos;s seal, and the letter is in Robert&apos;s own hand.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>I saved it for you.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Even Maester Pycelle was helpless, but he brought the milk of the poppy, so Jon did not linger long in pain.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>325</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The message said only that they were well, and had returned to the Eyrie,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>326</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I wish they had gone to Riverrun instead.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>349</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And he gives us no more notice than this?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>350</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How many in his party, did the message say?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>351</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I should think a hundred knights, at the least, with all their retainers, and half again as many freeriders.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Cersei and the children travel with them.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>354</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It is just as well.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quoteindex>412</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The fire is in our blood.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Drogo is so rich that even his slaves wear golden collars.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>414</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A hundred thousand men ride in his khalasar, and his palace in Vaes Dothrak has two hundred rooms and doors of solid silver.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>415</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Now you look all a princess,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>She is a vision, Your Grace, a vision,</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>424</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Drogo will be enraptured.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>425</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She&apos;s too skinny,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>426</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Are you sure that Khal Drogo likes his women this young?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>427</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She has had her blood.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>428</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She is old enough for the khal,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>429</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Look at her.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>430</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That silver-gold hair, those purple eyesâ€¦ she is the blood of old Valyria, no doubt, no doubtâ€¦ and highborn, daughter of the old king, sister to the new, she cannot fail to entrance our Drogo.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>431</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I suppose,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>432</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The savages have queer tastes.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>433</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Boys, horses, sheepâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>434</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Best not suggest this to Khal Drogo,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>435</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do you take me for a fool?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>436</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I take you for a king.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>437</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Kings lack the caution of common men.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>438</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My apologies if I have given offense.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>439</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We won&apos;t need his whole khalasar,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>440</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ten thousand, that would be enough, I could sweep the Seven Kingdoms with ten thousand Dothraki screamers.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>441</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The realm will rise for its rightful king.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>442</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Tyrell, Redwyne, Darry, Greyjoy, they have no more love for the Usurper than I do.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>443</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Dornishmen burn to avenge Elia and her children.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>444</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And the smallfolk will be with us.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>445</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They cry out for their king.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>446</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They do, don&apos;t they?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>447</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They are your people, and they love you well,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>448</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>In holdfasts all across the realm, men lift secret toasts to your health while women sew dragon banners and hide them against the day of your return from across the water.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>449</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Or so my agents tell me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>450</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I shall kill the Usurper myself,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>451</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>as he killed my brother Rhaegar.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>452</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And Lannister too, the Kingslayer, for what he did to my father.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>453</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That would be most fitting,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>454</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It is not that we fear these barbarians,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>455</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Lord of Light would hold our city walls against a million Dothraki, or so the red priests promiseâ€¦ yet why take chances, when their friendship comes so cheap?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>456</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Insolent eunuch,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>457</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Many important men will be at the feast tonight.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>458</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Such men have enemies.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>459</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The khal must protect his guests, yourself chief among them, Your Grace.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>460</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No doubt the Usurper would pay well for your head.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>461</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, yes,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>462</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He has tried, Illyrio, I promise you that.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>463</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>His hired knives follow us everywhere.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>The Usurper wanted his head,</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>477</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Some trifling affront.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>You have not changed at all.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>515</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your Grace.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>516</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Winterfell is yours.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>517</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Take me down to your crypt, Eddard.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>518</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I would pay my respects.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>519</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I was starting to think we would never reach Winterfell,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>520</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>In the south, the way they talk about my Seven Kingdoms, a man forgets that your part is as big as the other six combined.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>521</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I trust you enjoyed the journey, Your Grace?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>522</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Bogs and forests and fields, and scarcely a decent inn north of the Neck.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>523</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ve never seen such a vast emptiness.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>524</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Where are all your people?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>525</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Likely they were too shy to come out,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>526</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Kings are a rare sight in the north.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>527</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>More likely they were hiding under the snow.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>528</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Snow, Ned!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>529</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Late summer snows are common enough,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>530</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I hope they did not trouble you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>531</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They are usually mild.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>532</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Others take your mild snows,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>533</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What will this place be like in winter?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>534</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I shudder to think.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>535</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The winters are hard,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>536</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But the Starks will endure.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>537</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We always have.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>538</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You need to come south,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>539</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You need a taste of summer before it flees.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>540</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>In Highgarden there are fields of golden roses that stretch away as far as the eye can see.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>541</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The fruits are so ripe they explode in your mouthâ€”melons, peaches, fireplums, you&apos;ve never tasted such sweetness.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>542</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;ll see, I brought you some.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>543</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Even at Storm&apos;s End, with that good wind off the bay, the days are so hot you can barely move.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>544</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And you ought to see the towns, Ned!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>545</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Flowers everywhere, the markets bursting with food, the summerwines so cheap and so good that you can get drunk just breathing the air.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>546</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Everyone is fat and drunk and rich.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>547</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And the girls, Ned!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>548</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I swear, women lose all modesty in the heat.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>549</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They swim naked in the river, right beneath the castle.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>550</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Even in the streets, it&apos;s too damn hot for wool or fur, so they go around in these short gowns, silk if they have the silver and cotton if not, but it&apos;s all the same when they start sweating and the cloth sticks to their skin, they might as well be naked.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>551</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your Grace,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>552</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She is down at the end, with Father and Brandon.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>553</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Here,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>554</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She was more beautiful than that,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>555</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ah, damn it, Ned, did you have to bury her in a place like this?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>556</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She deserved more than darknessâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>557</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She was a Stark of Winterfell,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>558</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This is her place.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>559</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She should be on a hill somewhere, under a fruit tree, with the sun and clouds above her and the rain to wash her clean.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>560</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I was with her when she died,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>561</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She wanted to come home, to rest beside Brandon and Father.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>562</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I bring her flowers when I can,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>563</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lyanna wasâ€¦ fond of flowers.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>564</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I vowed to kill Rhaegar for what he did to her.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>565</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You did,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>566</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Only once,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>567</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>In my dreams, I kill him every night,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>568</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A thousand deaths will still be less than he deserves.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>569</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We should return, Your Grace.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>570</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your wife will be waiting.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>571</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Others take my wife,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>572</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And if I hear â€˜Your Graceâ€™ once more, I&apos;ll have your head on a spike.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>573</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We are more to each other than that.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>574</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I had not forgotten,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>575</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Tell me about Jon.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>576</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have never seen a man sicken so quickly.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>577</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We gave a tourney on my son&apos;s name day.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>578</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If you had seen Jon then, you would have sworn he would live forever.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>579</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A fortnight later he was dead.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>580</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The sickness was like a fire in his gut.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>581</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It burned right through him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>582</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I loved that old man.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>583</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We both did.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>584</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Catelyn fears for her sister.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>585</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How does Lysa bear her grief?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>586</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Not well, in truth,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>587</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I think losing Jon has driven the woman mad, Ned.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>588</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She has taken the boy back to the Eyrie.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>589</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Against my wishes.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>590</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I had hoped to foster him with Tywin Lannister at Casterly Rock.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>591</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Jon had no brothers, no other sons.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>592</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Was I supposed to leave him to be raised by women?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>593</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The wife has lost the husband,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>594</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Perhaps the mother feared to lose the son.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>595</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The boy is very young.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>596</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Six, and sickly, and Lord of the Eyrie, gods have mercy,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>597</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Tywin had never taken a ward before.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>598</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lysa ought to have been honored.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>599</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Lannisters are a great and noble House.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>600</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She refused to even hear of it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>601</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Then she left in the dead of night, without so much as a by-your-leave.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>602</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Cersei was furious.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>603</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The boy is my namesake, did you know that?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>604</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Robert Arryn.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>605</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I am sworn to protect him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>606</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How can I do that if his mother steals him away?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>607</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I will take him as ward, if you wish,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>608</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lysa should consent to that.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>609</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She and Catelyn were close as girls, and she would be welcome here as well.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>610</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A generous offer, my friend,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>611</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>but too late.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>612</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Tywin has already given his consent.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>613</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Fostering the boy elsewhere would be a grievous affront to him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>614</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have more concern for my nephew&apos;s welfare than I do for Lannister pride,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>615</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That is because you do not sleep with a Lannister.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>616</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ah, Ned,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>617</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>you are still too serious.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>618</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I had planned to wait a few days to speak to you, but I see now there&apos;s no need for it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>619</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Come, walk with me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>620</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You must have wondered why I finally came north to Winterfell, after so long.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>621</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>For the joy of my company, surely,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>622</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And there is the Wall.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>623</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You need to see it, Your Grace, to walk along its battlements and talk to those who man it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>624</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Night&apos;s Watch is a shadow of what it once was.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>625</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Benjen saysâ€”</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>626</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No doubt I will hear what your brother says soon enough,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>627</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Wall has stood for what, eight thousand years?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>628</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It can keep a few days more.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>629</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have more pressing concerns.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>630</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>These are difficult times.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>631</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I need good men about me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>632</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Men like Jon Arryn.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>633</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He served as Lord of the Eyrie, as Warden of the East, as the Hand of the King.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>634</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He will not be easy to replace.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>635</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>His sonâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>636</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>His son will succeed to the Eyrie and all its incomes,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>637</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No more.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>638</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Arryns have always been Wardens of the East.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>639</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The title goes with the domain.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>640</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Perhaps when he comes of age, the honor can be restored to him,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>641</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have this year to think of, and next.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>642</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A six-year-old boy is no war leader, Ned.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>643</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>In peace, the title is only an honor.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>644</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Let the boy keep it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>645</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>For his father&apos;s sake if not his own.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>646</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Surely you owe Jon that much for his service.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>647</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Jon&apos;s service was the duty he owed his liege lord.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>648</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I am not ungrateful, Ned.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>649</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You of all men ought to know that.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>650</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But the son is not the father.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>651</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A mere boy cannot hold the east.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>652</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Enough of this.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>653</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There is a more important office to discuss, and I would not argue with you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>654</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have need of you, Ned.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>655</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I am yours to command, Your Grace.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>656</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Always.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>657</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Those years we spent in the Eyrieâ€¦ gods, those were good years.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>658</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I want you at my side again, Ned.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>659</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I want you down in King&apos;s Landing, not up here at the end of the world where you are no damned use to anybody.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>660</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I understand,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>661</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I think you do.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>662</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If so, you are the only one, my old friend.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>663</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Eddard Stark, I would name you the Hand of the King.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>664</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your Grace,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>665</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I am not worthy of the honor.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>666</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If I wanted to honor you, I&apos;d let you retire.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>667</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I am planning to make you run the kingdom and fight the wars while I eat and drink and wench myself into an early grave.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>668</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You know the saying, about the king and his Hand?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>669</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What the king dreams,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>670</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>the Hand builds.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>671</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I bedded a fishmaid once who told me the lowborn have a choicer way to put it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>672</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The king eats, they say, and the Hand takes the shit.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>673</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Damn it, Ned,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>674</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You might at least humor me with a smile.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>675</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They say it grows so cold up here in winter that a man&apos;s laughter freezes in his throat and chokes him to death,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>676</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Perhaps that is why the Starks have so little humor.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>677</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Come south with me, and I&apos;ll teach you how to laugh again,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>678</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You helped me win this damnable throne, now help me hold it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>679</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We were meant to rule together.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>680</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If Lyanna had lived, we should have been brothers, bound by blood as well as affection.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>My Joff and your Sansa shall join our houses, as Lyanna and I might once have done.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>685</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Sansa is only eleven.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>686</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Old enough for betrothal.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Yes,</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>Ah, well.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>I believe I was younger than you the first time I got truly and sincerely drunk.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>707</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A very quiet wolf,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>708</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He&apos;s not like the others,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>709</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He never makes a sound.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>710</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That&apos;s why I named him Ghost.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>711</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That, and because he&apos;s white.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>712</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The others are all dark, grey or black.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>There are still direwolves beyond the Wall.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Don&apos;t you usually eat at table with your brothers?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>716</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Most times,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>717</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But tonight Lady Stark thought it might give insult to the royal family to seat a bastard among them.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>718</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I see.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>719</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My brother does not seem very festive tonight.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>You don&apos;t miss much, do you, Jon?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>724</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We could use a man like you on the Wall.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>725</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Robb is a stronger lance than I am, but I&apos;m the better sword, and Hullen says I sit a horse as well as anyone in the castle.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>726</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Notable achievements.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>727</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Take me with you when you go back to the Wall,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>728</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Father will give me leave to go if you ask him, I know he will.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>The Wall is a hard place for a boy, Jon.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>730</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I am almost a man grown,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>731</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I will turn fifteen on my next name day, and Maester Luwin says bastards grow up faster than other children.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>732</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That&apos;s true enough,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Daeren Targaryen was only fourteen when he conquered Dorne,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>734</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A conquest that lasted a summer,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>735</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your Boy King lost ten thousand men taking the place, and another fifty trying to hold it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>736</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Someone should have told him that war isn&apos;t a game.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>737</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Also,</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>Daeren Targaryen was only eighteen when he died.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Or have you forgotten that part?</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>You don&apos;t know what you&apos;re asking, Jon.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>The Night&apos;s Watch is a sworn brotherhood.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>744</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We have no families.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>745</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>None of us will ever father sons.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>746</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Our wife is duty.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>747</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Our mistress is honor.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>A bastard can have honor too,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>749</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I am ready to swear your oath.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>750</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You are a boy of fourteen,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>751</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Not a man, not yet.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>752</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Until you have known a woman, you cannot understand what you would be giving up.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>753</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I don&apos;t care about that!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>754</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You might, if you knew what it meant,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>755</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If you knew what the oath would cost you, you might be less eager to pay the price, son.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>756</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m not your son!</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>More&apos;s the pity.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>758</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Come back to me after you&apos;ve fathered a few bastards of your own, and we&apos;ll see how you feel.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>759</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I will never father a bastard,</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>760</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Never!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>761</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I must be excused,</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>762</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Boy,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>763</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Is that animal a wolf?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>764</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A direwolf,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>765</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>His name is Ghost.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>766</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What are you doing up there?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>767</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why aren&apos;t you at the feast?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>768</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Too hot, too noisy, and I&apos;d drunk too much wine,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>769</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I learned long ago that it is considered rude to vomit on your brother.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>770</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Might I have a closer look at your wolf?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>771</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Can you climb down, or shall I bring a ladder?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>772</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, bleed that,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>773</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I believe I&apos;ve frightened your wolf.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>774</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My apologies.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>775</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He&apos;s not scared,</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>776</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ghost, come here.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>777</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Come on.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>778</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That&apos;s it.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>779</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Shy, isn&apos;t he?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>780</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Sit, Ghost,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>781</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That&apos;s it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>782</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Keep still.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>783</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You can touch him now.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>784</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He won&apos;t move until I tell him to.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>785</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ve been training him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>786</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I see,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>787</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Nice wolf.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>788</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If I wasn&apos;t here, he&apos;d tear out your throat,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>789</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>In that case, you had best stay close,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>790</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I am Tyrion Lannister.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>791</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I know,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>792</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;re Ned Stark&apos;s bastard, aren&apos;t you?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>793</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Did I offend you?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>794</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Sorry.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>795</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Dwarfs don&apos;t have to be tactful.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>796</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Generations of capering fools in motley have won me the right to dress badly and say any damn thing that comes into my head.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>797</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You are the bastard, though.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>798</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Eddard Stark is my father,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>799</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>800</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I can see it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>801</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You have more of the north in you than your brothers.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>802</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Half brothers,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>803</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Let me give you some counsel, bastard,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>804</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Never forget what you are, for surely the world will not.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>805</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Make it your strength.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>806</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Then it can never be your weakness.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>807</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Armor yourself in it, and it will never be used to hurt you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>808</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What do you know about being a bastard?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>809</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>All dwarfs are bastards in their father&apos;s eyes.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>810</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You are your mother&apos;s trueborn son of Lannister.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>811</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Am I?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>812</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do tell my lord father.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>813</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My mother died birthing me, and he&apos;s never been sure.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>814</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I don&apos;t even know who my mother was,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>815</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Some woman, no doubt.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>816</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Most of them are.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>817</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Remember this, boy.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>818</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>All dwarfs may be bastards, yet not all bastards need be dwarfs.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>819</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I will refuse him,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>820</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You cannot.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>821</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You must not.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>822</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My duties are here in the north.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>823</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have no wish to be Robert&apos;s Hand.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>824</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He will not understand that.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>825</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He is a king now, and kings are not like other men.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>826</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If you refuse to serve him, he will wonder why, and sooner or later he will begin to suspect that you oppose him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>827</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Can&apos;t you see the danger that would put us in?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>828</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Robert would never harm me or any of mine.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>829</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We were closer than brothers.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>830</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He loves me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>831</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If I refuse him, he will roar and curse and bluster, and in a week we will laugh about it together.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>832</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I know the man!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>833</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You knew the man,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>834</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The king is a stranger to you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>835</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Pride is everything to a king, my lord.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>836</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Robert came all this way to see you, to bring you these great honors, you cannot throw them back in his face.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>837</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Honors?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>838</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>In his eyes, yes,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>839</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And in yours?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>840</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And in mine,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>841</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He offers his own son in marriage to our daughter, what else would you call that?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>842</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Sansa might someday be queen.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>843</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Her sons could rule from the Wall to the mountains of Dorne.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>844</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What is so wrong with that?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>845</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Gods, Catelyn, Sansa is only eleven,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>846</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And Joffreyâ€¦ Joffrey isâ€¦</quotetext>

		<quotetext>â€¦crown prince, and heir to the Iron Throne.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Brandon.</quotetext>
	</quote>

	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>854</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You, Winterfell, everything.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>855</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He was born to be a King&apos;s Hand and a father to queens.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>856</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I never asked for this cup to pass to me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>857</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Perhaps not,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>858</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>but Brandon is dead, and the cup has passed, and you must drink from it, like it or not.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>859</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What is it?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>860</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My lord, Maester Luwin is without and begs urgent audience.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>861</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You told him I had left orders not to be disturbed?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>862</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes, my lord.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>863</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He insists.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>864</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Very well.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>865</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Send him in.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>866</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Perhaps we should close the windows,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>867</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My lord,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>868</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>pardon for disturbing your rest.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>869</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have been left a message.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>870</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Been left?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>871</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>By whom?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>872</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Has there been a rider?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>873</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I was not told.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>874</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There was no rider, my lord.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>875</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Only a carved wooden box, left on a table in my observatory while I napped.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>876</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My servants saw no one, but it must have been brought by someone in the king&apos;s party.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>877</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We have had no other visitors from the south.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>878</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A wooden box, you say?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>879</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Inside was a fine new lens for the observatory, from Myr by the look of it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>880</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The lenscrafters of Myr are without equal.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>881</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A lens,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>882</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What has that to do with me?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>883</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I asked the same question,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>884</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Clearly there was more to this than the seeming.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>885</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A lens is an instrument to help us see.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>886</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Indeed it is.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>887</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What is it that they would have us see more clearly?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>888</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The very thing I asked myself.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>889</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I found the true message concealed within a false bottom when I dismantled the box the lens had come in, but it is not for my eyes.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>890</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Let me have it, then.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>891</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Pardons, my lord.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>892</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The message is not for you either.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>893</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It is marked for the eyes of the Lady Catelyn, and her alone.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>894</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>May I approach?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>895</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Stay,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>896</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What is it?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>897</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My lady, you&apos;re shaking.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>898</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m afraid,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>899</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s from Lysa.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>900</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It will not make us glad,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>901</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There is grief in this message, Ned.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>902</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I can feel it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>903</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Open it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>904</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lysa took no chances.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>905</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>When we were girls together, we had a private language, she and I.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>906</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Can you read it?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>907</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>908</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Then tell us.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>909</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Perhaps I should withdraw,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>910</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>911</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We will need your counsel.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>912</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What are you doing?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>913</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lighting a fire,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>914</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Maester Luwinâ€”</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>915</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Maester Luwin has delivered all my children,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>916</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This is no time for false modesty.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>917</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My lady, tell me!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>918</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What was this message?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>919</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A warning,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>920</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If we have the wits to hear.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>921</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Go on.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>922</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lysa says Jon Arryn was murdered.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>923</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>By whom?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>924</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Lannisters,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>925</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The queen.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>926</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Gods,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>927</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your sister is sick with grief.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>928</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She cannot know what she is saying.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>929</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She knows,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>930</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lysa is impulsive, yes, but this message was carefully planned, cleverly hidden.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>931</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She knew it meant death if her letter fell into the wrong hands.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>932</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>To risk so much, she must have had more than mere suspicion.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>933</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Now we truly have no choice.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>934</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You must be Robert&apos;s Hand.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>935</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You must go south with him and learn the truth.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>936</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The only truths I know are here.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>937</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The south is a nest of adders I would do better to avoid.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>938</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Hand of the King has great power, my lord.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>939</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Power to find the truth of Lord Arryn&apos;s death, to bring his killers to the king&apos;s justice.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>940</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Power to protect Lady Arryn and her son, if the worst be true.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>941</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You say you love Robert like a brother.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>942</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Would you leave your brother surrounded by Lannisters?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>943</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Others take both of you,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>944</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My father went south once, to answer the summons of a king.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>945</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He never came home again.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>946</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A different time,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>947</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A different king.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>948</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>949</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Catelyn, you shall stay here in Winterfell.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>950</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>951</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>952</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You must govern the north in my stead, while I run Robert&apos;s errands.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>953</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There must always be a Stark in Winterfell.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>954</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Robb is fourteen.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>955</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Soon enough, he will be a man grown.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>956</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He must learn to rule, and I will not be here for him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>957</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Make him part of your councils.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>958</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He must be ready when his time comes.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>959</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Gods will, not for many years,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>960</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Maester Luwin, I trust you as I would my own blood.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>961</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Give my wife your voice in all things great and small.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>962</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Teach my son the things he needs to know.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>963</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Winter is coming.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>964</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What of the other children?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>965</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Rickon is very young,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>966</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He should stay here with you and Robb.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>967</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The others I would take with me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>968</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I could not bear it,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>969</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You must,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>970</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Sansa must wed Joffrey, that is clear now, we must give them no grounds to suspect our devotion.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>971</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And it is past time that Arya learned the ways of a southron court.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>972</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>In a few years she will be of an age to marry too.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>973</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>974</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>but please, Ned, for the love you bear me, let Bran remain here at Winterfell.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>975</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He is only seven.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>976</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I was eight when my father sent me to foster at the Eyrie,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>977</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ser Rodrik tells me there is bad feeling between Robb and Prince Joffrey.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>978</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That is not healthy.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>979</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Bran can bridge that distance.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>980</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He is a sweet boy, quick to laugh, easy to love.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>981</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Let him grow up with the young princes, let him become their friend as Robert became mine.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>982</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Our House will be the safer for it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>983</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Keep him off the walls, then,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>984</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You know how Bran loves to climb.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>985</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Thank you, my lady,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>986</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This is hard, I know.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>987</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What of Jon Snow, my lord?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>988</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>son</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>989</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Never ask me about Jon,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>990</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He is my blood, and that is all you need to know.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>991</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And now I will learn where you heard that name, my lady.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>992</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Jon must go,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>993</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He and Robb are close,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>994</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I had hopedâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>995</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He cannot stay here,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>996</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He is your son, not mine.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>997</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I will not have him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>998</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You know I cannot take him south.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>999</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There will be no place for him at court.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1000</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A boy with a bastard&apos;s nameâ€¦ you know what they will say of him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1001</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He will be shunned.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1002</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They say your friend Robert has fathered a dozen bastards himself.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1003</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And none of them has ever been seen at court!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1004</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Lannister woman has seen to that.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1005</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How can you be so damnably cruel, Catelyn?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1006</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He is only a boy.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1007</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Heâ€”</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1008</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Another solution presents itself,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1009</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your brother Benjen came to me about Jon a few days ago.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1010</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It seems the boy aspires to take the black.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1011</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He asked to join the Night&apos;s Watch?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1012</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There is great honor in service on the Wall, my lord.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1013</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And even a bastard may rise high in the Night&apos;s Watch,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1014</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Jon is so young.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1015</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If he asked this when he was a man grown, that would be one thing, but a boy of fourteenâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1016</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A hard sacrifice,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1017</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yet these are hard times, my lord.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1018</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>His road is no crueler than yours or your lady&apos;s.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1019</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Very well,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1020</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I suppose it is for the best.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1021</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I will speak to Ben.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1022</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>When shall we tell Jon?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1023</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>When I must.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1024</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Preparations must be made.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1025</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It will be a fortnight before we are ready to depart.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1026</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I would sooner let Jon enjoy these last few days.</quotetext>
	</quote>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1033</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Tell me,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1034</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We were talking about the prince,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Joffrey likes your sister,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1036</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He told her she was very beautiful.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>He&apos;s going to marry her,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>What did you think of Prince Joff, sister?</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>He&apos;s very gallant, don&apos;t you think?</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Jon says he looks like a girl,</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>1043</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Poor Jon,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1044</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He gets jealous because he&apos;s a bastard.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Our half brother,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Arya and I were remarking on how pleased we were to have the princess with us today,</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>1049</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Indeed.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>1055</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This will not do.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Your lady mother will hear of this.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1060</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>In front of our royal princess too!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1061</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;ll shame us all!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1062</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>By your leave, my lady.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1063</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Just where do you think you are going, Arya?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1064</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have to go shoe a horse,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1065</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lady.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1066</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Come,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1067</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Shouldn&apos;t you be working on your stitches, little sister?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1068</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I wanted to see them fight.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1069</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Come here, then.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1070</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A shade more exhausting than needlework,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1071</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A shade more fun than needlework,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1072</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why aren&apos;t you down in the yard?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1073</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Bastards are not allowed to damage young princes,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1074</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Any bruises they take in the practice yard must come from trueborn swords.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1075</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1076</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I could do just as good as Bran,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1077</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He&apos;s only seven.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1078</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m nine.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1079</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;re too skinny,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1080</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I doubt you could even lift a longsword, little sister, never mind swing one.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1081</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You see Prince Joffrey?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1082</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Look at the arms on his surcoat,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1083</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Lannisters are proud,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1084</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;d think the royal sigil would be sufficient, but no.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1085</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He makes his mother&apos;s House equal in honor to the king&apos;s.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1086</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The woman is important too!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1087</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Perhaps you should do the same thing, little sister.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1088</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Wed Tully to Stark in your arms.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1089</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A wolf with a fish in its mouth?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1090</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That would look silly.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1091</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Besides, if a girl can&apos;t fight, why should she have a coat of arms?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1092</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Girls get the arms but not the swords.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1093</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Bastards get the swords but not the arms.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1094</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I did not make the rules, little sister.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1095</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Enough!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1096</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well fought.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>Lew, Donnis, help them out of their armor.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Prince Joffrey, Robb, will you go another round?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1099</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Gladly.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1100</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This is a game for children, Ser Rodrik.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1101</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You are children,</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>1102</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Robb may be a child,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>I am a prince.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1104</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And I grow tired of swatting at Starks with a play sword.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1105</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You got more swats than you gave, Joff,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1106</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Are you afraid?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1107</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, terrified,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1108</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;re so much older.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1109</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Joffrey is truly a little shit,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1110</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What are you suggesting?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1111</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Live steel.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1112</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Done,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1113</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;ll be sorry!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1114</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Live steel is too dangerous.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1115</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I will permit you tourney swords, with blunted edges.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1116</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This is your prince.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1117</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Who are you to tell him he may not have an edge on his sword, ser?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1118</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Master-at-arms of Winterfell, Clegane, and you would do well not to forget it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1119</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Are you training women here?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1120</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I am training knights,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1121</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They will have steel when they are ready.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1122</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>When they are of an age.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1123</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How old are you, boy?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1124</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Fourteen,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1125</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I killed a man at twelve.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1126</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You can be sure it was not with a blunt sword.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1127</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Let me do it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1128</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I can beat him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1129</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Beat him with a tourney blade, then,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1130</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Come and see me when you&apos;re older, Stark.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1131</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If you&apos;re not too old.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Come, Tommen,</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>1133</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The hour of play is done.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1134</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Leave the children to their frolics.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1135</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The show is done,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>You had best run back to your room, little sister.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Septa Mordane will surely be lurking.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>You&apos;ll be sewing all through winter.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>When the spring thaw comes, they will find your body with a needle still locked tight between your frozen fingers.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>1141</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I hate needlework!</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>1142</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s not fair!</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>1149</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Quiet,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>You&apos;re not my son,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>I stopped by the sickroom last night,</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>1288</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There was no change.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1289</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The maester thought that a hopeful sign.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>1290</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I don&apos;t want Brandon to die,</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>1291</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Eddard had a brother named Brandon as well,</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>1292</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>One of the hostages murdered by Targaryen.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>1293</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It seems to be an unlucky name.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>1294</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, not so unlucky as all that, surely,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1295</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What do you mean?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1296</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why, only that Tommen may get his wish.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1297</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The maester thinks the boy may yet live.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1298</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That is no mercy.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>These northern gods are cruel to let the child linger in such pain.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>1300</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What were the maester&apos;s words?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1301</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He thinks that if the boy were going to die, he would have done so already.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1302</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It has been four days with no change.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1303</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Will Bran get better, Uncle?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1304</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>His back is broken, little one,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1305</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The fall shattered his legs as well.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1306</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They keep him alive with honey and water, or he would starve to death.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1307</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Perhaps, if he wakes, he will be able to eat real food, but he will never walk again.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1308</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If he wakes,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1309</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Is that likely?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1310</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The gods alone know,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1311</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The maester only hopes.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1312</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I would swear that wolf of his is keeping the boy alive.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1313</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The creature is outside his window day and night, howling.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1314</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Every time they chase it away, it returns.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1315</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The maester said they closed the window once, to shut out the noise, and Bran seemed to weaken.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1316</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>When they opened it again, his heart beat stronger.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1317</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There is something unnatural about those animals,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1318</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They are dangerous.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1319</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I will not have any of them coming south with us.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>You&apos;ll have a hard time stopping them, sister.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Tommen, Myrcella, come.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1335</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Stark will never consent to leave Winterfell with his son lingering in the shadow of death.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1336</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He will if Robert commands it,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>And Robert will command it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>There is nothing Lord Eddard can do for the boy in any case.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>1339</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He could end his torment,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>I would, if it were my son.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>It would be a mercy.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1342</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I advise against putting that suggestion to Lord Eddard, sweet brother,</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>1343</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He would not take it kindly.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>Worse than a cripple.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>That damnable wheelhouse, the way it creaks and groans, climbing every bump in the road as if it were a mountainâ€¦ I promise you, if that wretched thing breaks another axle, I&apos;m going to burn it, and Cersei can walk!</quotetext>

		<quotetext>What do you say, Ned?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1564</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Just you and me, two vagabond knights on the kingsroad, our swords at our sides and the gods know what in front of us, and maybe a farmer&apos;s daughter or a tavern wench to warm our beds tonight.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1565</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Would that we could,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1566</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>but we have duties now, my liegeâ€¦ to the realm, to our children, I to my lady wife and you to your queen.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1567</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We are not the boys we were.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>You were never the boy you were,</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1569</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>More&apos;s the pity.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1570</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And yet there was that one timeâ€¦ what was her name, that common girl of yours?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1571</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Becca?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1572</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No, she was one of mine, gods love her, black hair and these sweet big eyes, you could drown in them.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1573</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yours wasâ€¦ Aleena?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1574</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1575</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You told me once.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1576</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Was it Merryl?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1577</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You know the one I mean, your bastard&apos;s mother?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1578</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Her name was Wylla,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1579</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>and I would sooner not speak of her.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1580</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Wylla.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1581</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1582</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She must have been a rare wench if she could make Lord Eddard Stark forget his honor, even for an hour.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1583</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You never told me what she looked likeâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1584</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Nor will I.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1585</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Leave it be, Robert, for the love you say you bear me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1586</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I dishonored myself and I dishonored Catelyn, in the sight of gods and men.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1587</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Gods have mercy, you scarcely knew Catelyn.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1588</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I had taken her to wife.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1589</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She was carrying my child.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1590</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You are too hard on yourself, Ned.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1591</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You always were.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1592</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Damn it, no woman wants Baelor the Blessed in her bed.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1593</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well, I&apos;ll not press you if you feel so strong about it, though I swear, at times you&apos;re so prickly you ought to take the hedgehog as your sigil.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1594</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The barrows of the First Men.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1595</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Have we ridden onto a graveyard?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1596</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There are barrows everywhere in the north, Your Grace,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1597</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This land is old.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1598</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And cold,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1599</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well, I did not bring you out here to talk of graves or bicker about your bastard.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1600</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There was a rider in the night, from Lord Varys in King&apos;s Landing.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1601</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Here.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1602</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What is the source for this information?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1603</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do you remember Ser Jorah Mormont?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1604</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Would that I might forget him,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1605</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ser Jorah is now in Pentos, anxious to earn a royal pardon that would allow him to return from exile,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1606</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Varys makes good use of him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1607</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So the slaver has become a spy,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1608</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I would rather he become a corpse.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1609</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Varys tells me that spies are more useful than corpses,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1610</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Jorah aside, what do you make of his report?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1611</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Daenerys Targaryen has wed some Dothraki horselord.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1612</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What of it?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1613</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Shall we send her a wedding gift?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1614</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A knife, perhaps.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1615</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A good sharp one, and a bold man to wield it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1616</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I see no babes.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1617</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Only dragonspawn.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1618</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your Grace, the girl is scarcely more than a child.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1619</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You are no Tywin Lannister, to slaughter innocents.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1620</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And how long will this one remain an innocent?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1621</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This child will soon enough spread her legs and start breeding more dragonspawn to plague me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1622</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Nonetheless,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1623</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>the murder of childrenâ€¦ it would be vileâ€¦ unspeakableâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1624</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Unspeakable?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1625</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What Aerys did to your brother Brandon was unspeakable.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1626</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The way your lord father died, that was unspeakable.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1627</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And Rhaegarâ€¦ how many times do you think he raped your sister?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1628</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How many hundreds of times?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1629</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I will kill every Targaryen I can get my hands on, until they are as dead as their dragons, and then I will piss on their graves.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1630</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You can&apos;t get your hands on this one, can you?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1631</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No, gods be cursed.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1632</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Some pox-ridden Pentoshi cheesemonger had her brother and her walled up on his estate with pointy-hatted eunuchs all around them, and now he&apos;s handed them over to the Dothraki.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1633</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I should have had them both killed years ago, when it was easy to get at them, but Jon was as bad as you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1634</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>More fool I, I listened to him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1635</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Jon Arryn was a wise man and a good Hand.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1636</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This Khal Drogo is said to have a hundred thousand men in his horde.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1637</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What would Jon say to that?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1638</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He would say that even a million Dothraki are no threat to the realm, so long as they remain on the other side of the narrow sea,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1639</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The barbarians have no ships.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1640</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They hate and fear the open sea.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1641</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Perhaps.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1642</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There are ships to be had in the Free Cities, though.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1643</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I tell you, Ned, I do not like this marriage.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1644</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms who call me Usurper.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1645</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do you forget how many houses fought for Targaryen in the war?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1646</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They bide their time for now, but give them half a chance, they will murder me in my bed, and my sons with me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1647</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If the beggar king crosses with a Dothraki horde at his back, the traitors will join him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1648</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He will not cross,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1649</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And if by some mischance he does, we will throw him back into the sea.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1650</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Once you choose a new Warden of the Eastâ€”</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1651</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>For the last time, I will not name the Arryn boy Warden.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1652</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I know the boy is your nephew, but with Targaryens climbing in bed with Dothraki, I would be mad to rest one quarter of the realm on the shoulders of a sickly child.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1653</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yet we still must have a Warden of the East.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1654</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If Robert Arryn will not do, name one of your brothers.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1655</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Stannis proved himself at the siege of Storm&apos;s End, surely.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1656</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That is,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1657</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>unless you have already promised the honor to another.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1658</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What if I have?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1659</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s Jaime Lannister, is it not?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1660</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1661</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Kingslayer,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1662</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>An able and courageous man, no doubt,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1663</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>but his father is Warden of the West, Robert.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1664</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>In time Ser Jaime will succeed to that honor.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1665</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No one man should hold both East and West.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1666</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I will fight that battle when the enemy appears on the field,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1667</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>At the moment, Lord Tywin looms eternal as Casterly Rock, so I doubt that Jaime will be succeeding anytime soon.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1668</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Don&apos;t vex me about this, Ned, the stone has been set.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1669</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your Grace, may I speak frankly?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1670</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I seem unable to stop you,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1671</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Can you trust Jaime Lannister?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1672</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He is my wife&apos;s twin, a Sworn Brother of the Kingsguard, his life and fortune and honor all bound to mine.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1673</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>As they were bound to Aerys Targaryen&apos;s,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1674</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why should I mistrust him?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1675</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He has done everything I have ever asked of him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1676</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>His sword helped win the throne I sit on.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1677</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He swore a vow to protect his king&apos;s life with his own.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1678</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Then he opened that king&apos;s throat with a sword.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1679</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Seven hells, someone had to kill Aerys!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1680</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If Jaime hadn&apos;t done it, it would have been left for you or me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1681</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We were not Sworn Brothers of the Kingsguard,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1682</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do you remember the Trident, Your Grace?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1683</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I won my crown there.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1684</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How should I forget it?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1685</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You took a wound from Rhaegar,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1686</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So when the Targaryen host broke and ran, you gave the pursuit into my hands.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1687</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The remnants of Rhaegar&apos;s army fled back to King&apos;s Landing.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1688</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We followed.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1689</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Aerys was in the Red Keep with several thousand loyalists.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1690</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I expected to find the gates closed to us.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1691</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Instead you found that our men had already taken the city.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1692</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What of it?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1693</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Not our men,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1694</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lannister men.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1695</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The lion of Lannister flew over the ramparts, not the crowned stag.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1696</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And they had taken the city by treachery.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Treachery was a coin the Targaryens knew well,</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1698</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lannister paid them back in kind.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>You were not there,</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>1702</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There was no honor in that conquest.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Go down into your crypt and ask Lyanna about the dragon&apos;s honor!</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>1706</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You avenged Lyanna at the Trident,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>That did not bring her back.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>The gods be damned.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>It was a hollow victory they gave me.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>A crownâ€¦ it was the girl I prayed them for.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>I cannot answer for the gods, Your Graceâ€¦ only for what I found when I rode into the throne room that day,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Aerys was dead on the floor, drowned in his own blood.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1716</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>His dragon skulls stared down from the walls.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1717</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lannister&apos;s men were everywhere.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1718</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Jaime wore the white cloak of the Kingsguard over his golden armor.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1719</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I can see him still.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1720</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Even his sword was gilded.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1721</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He was seated on the Iron Throne, high above his knights, wearing a helm fashioned in the shape of a lion&apos;s head.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1722</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How he glittered!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1723</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This is well known,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1724</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I was still mounted.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1725</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I rode the length of the hall in silence, between the long rows of dragon skulls.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1726</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It felt as though they were watching me, somehow.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1727</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I stopped in front of the throne, looking up at him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1728</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>His golden sword was across his legs, its edge red with a king&apos;s blood.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1729</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My men were filling the room behind me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1730</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lannister&apos;s men drew back.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1731</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I never said a word.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1732</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I looked at him seated there on the throne, and I waited.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1733</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>At last Jaime laughed and got up.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1734</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He took off his helm, and he said to me, â€˜Have no fear, Stark.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1735</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I was only keeping it warm for our friend Robert.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1736</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s not a very comfortable seat, I&apos;m afraid.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1737</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You think I should mistrust Lannister because he sat on my throne for a few moments?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1738</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Jaime was all of seventeen, Ned.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1739</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Scarce more than a boy.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1740</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Boy or man, he had no right to that throne.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1741</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Perhaps he was tired,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1742</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Killing kings is weary work.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1743</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Gods know, there&apos;s no place else to rest your ass in that damnable room.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1744</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And he spoke truly, it is a monstrous uncomfortable chair.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1745</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>In more ways than one.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1746</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well, now I know Jaime&apos;s dark sin, and the matter can be forgotten.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1747</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I am heartily sick of secrets and squabbles and matters of state, Ned.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1748</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s all as tedious as counting coppers.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>1749</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Come, let&apos;s ride, you used to know how.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1750</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I want to feel the wind in my hair again.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>The wolfswood,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Rapers,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>I warn you, Lannister, you&apos;ll find no inns at the Wall,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1754</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No doubt you&apos;ll find some place to put me,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1755</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>As you might have noticed, I&apos;m small.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1756</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You will not like the ride, I promise you that,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1757</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why do you read so much?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1758</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Look at me and tell me what you see.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1759</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Is this some kind of trick?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1760</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I see you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1761</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Tyrion Lannister.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1762</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You are remarkably polite for a bastard, Snow.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1763</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What you see is a dwarf.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1764</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You are what, twelve?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1765</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Fourteen,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1766</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Fourteen, and you&apos;re taller than I will ever be.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1767</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My legs are short and twisted, and I walk with difficulty.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1768</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I require a special saddle to keep from falling off my horse.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1769</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A saddle of my own design, you may be interested to know.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1770</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It was either that or ride a pony.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1771</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My arms are strong enough, but again, too short.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1772</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I will never make a swordsman.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1773</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Had I been born a peasant, they might have left me out to die, or sold me to some slaver&apos;s grotesquerie.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1774</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Alas, I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock, and the grotesqueries are all the poorer.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1775</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Things are expected of me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1776</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My father was the Hand of the King for twenty years.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1777</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My brother later killed that very same king, as it turns out, but life is full of these little ironies.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1778</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My sister married the new king and my repulsive nephew will be king after him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1779</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I must do my part for the honor of my House, wouldn&apos;t you agree?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1780</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yet how?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1781</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well, my legs may be too small for my body, but my head is too large, although I prefer to think it is just large enough for my mind.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1782</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have a realistic grasp of my own strengths and weaknesses.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1783</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My mind is my weapon.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1784</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My brother has his sword, King Robert has his warhammer, and I have my mindâ€¦ and a mind needs books as a sword needs a whetstone, if it is to keep its edge.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1785</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That&apos;s why I read so much, Jon Snow.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1786</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What are you reading about?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1787</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Dragons,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1788</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What good is that?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1789</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There are no more dragons,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1790</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So they say,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1791</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Sad, isn&apos;t it?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1792</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>When I was your age, used to dream of having a dragon of my own.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1793</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You did?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1794</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, yes.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1795</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Even a stunted, twisted, ugly little boy can look down over the world when he&apos;s seated on a dragon&apos;s back.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1796</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I used to start fires in the bowels of Casterly Rock and stare at the flames for hours, pretending they were dragonfire.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1797</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Sometimes I&apos;d imagine my father burning.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1798</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>At other times, my sister.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1799</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Don&apos;t look at me that way, bastard.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1800</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I know your secret.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1801</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;ve dreamt the same kind of dreams.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1802</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1803</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I wouldn&apos;tâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1804</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1805</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Never?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1806</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well, no doubt the Starks have been terribly good to you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1807</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m certain Lady Stark treats you as if you were one of her own.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1808</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And your brother Robb, he&apos;s always been kind, and why not?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1809</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He gets Winterfell and you get the Wall.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1810</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And your fatherâ€¦ he must have good reasons for packing you off to the Night&apos;s Watchâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1811</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Stop it,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1812</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Night&apos;s Watch is a noble calling!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1813</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;re too smart to believe that.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1814</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Night&apos;s Watch is a midden heap for all the misfits of the realm.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1815</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ve seen you looking at Yoren and his boys.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1816</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Those are your new brothers, Jon Snow, how do you like them?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1817</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Sullen peasants, debtors, poachers, rapers, thieves, and bastards like you all wind up on the Wall, watching for grumkins and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1818</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The good part is there are no grumkins or snarks, so it&apos;s scarcely dangerous work.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1819</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The bad part is you freeze your balls off, but since you&apos;re not allowed to breed anyway, I don&apos;t suppose that matters.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1820</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Stop it!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1821</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Help me,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1822</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Don&apos;t help me, then.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1823</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ll sit right here until you leave.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1824</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ask me nicely.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1825</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I should be very grateful for your kind assistance, Jon,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1826</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Down, Ghost,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1827</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why did he attack me?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1828</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Maybe he thought you were a grumkin.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1829</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, gods,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1830</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I suppose I do rather look like a grumkin.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1831</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What does he do to snarks?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1832</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You don&apos;t want to know.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1833</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Want some?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1834</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s true, isn&apos;t it?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1835</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What you said about the Night&apos;s Watch.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1836</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If that&apos;s what it is, that&apos;s what it is.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1837</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That&apos;s good, bastard.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1838</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Most men would rather deny a hard truth than face it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1839</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Most men,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1840</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But not you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1841</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1842</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>not me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1843</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I seldom even dream of dragons anymore.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1844</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There are no dragons.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1845</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Come, we had better return to camp before your uncle calls the banners.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1846</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>More pepper,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1847</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There you are.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1848</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Jon, damn it, don&apos;t go off like that by yourself.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1849</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I thought the Others had gotten you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1850</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It was the grumkins,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>It is past time that we reviewed the figures, my lady,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1852</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;ll want to know how much this royal visit cost us.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>I have no need to look at figures, Maester Luwin,</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>1854</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I know what the visit cost us.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>Take the books away.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>My lady, the king&apos;s party had healthy appetites.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1857</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We must replenish our stores beforeâ€”</quotetext>

		<quotetext>My son lies here broken and dying, Luwin, and you wish to discuss a new master of horse?</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>1870</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do you think I care what happens in the stables?</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>1873</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do you?</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Bring me some bread and honey,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>and take word to Maester Luwin that my bandages want changing.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1942</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Who was he?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1943</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No one knows his name,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1944</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He was no man of Winterfell, m&apos;lady, but some says they seen him here and about the castle these past few weeks.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1945</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>One of the king&apos;s men, then,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1946</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>or one of the Lannistersâ€™.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1947</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He could have waited behind when the others left.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1948</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Maybe,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1949</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>With all these strangers filling up Winterfell of late, there&apos;s no way of saying who he belonged to.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1950</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He&apos;d been hiding in your stables,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1951</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You could smell it on him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1952</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And how could he go unnoticed?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1953</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Between the horses Lord Eddard took south and them we sent north to the Night&apos;s Watch, the stalls were half-empty.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1954</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It were no great trick to hide from the stableboys.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1955</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Could be Hodor saw him, the talk is that boy&apos;s been acting queer, but simple as he isâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1956</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We found where he&apos;d been sleeping,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1957</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He had ninety silver stags in a leather bag buried beneath the straw.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1958</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s good to know my son&apos;s life was not sold cheaply,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1959</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Begging your grace, m&apos;lady, you saying he was out to kill your boy?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1960</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That&apos;s madness.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1961</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He came for Bran,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1962</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He kept muttering how I wasn&apos;t supposed to be there.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1963</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He set the library fire thinking I would rush to put it out, taking any guards with me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1964</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If I hadn&apos;t been half-mad with grief, it would have worked.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1965</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why would anyone want to kill Bran?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1966</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Gods, he&apos;s only a little boy, helpless, sleepingâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1967</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If you are to rule in the north, you must think these things through, Robb.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1968</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Answer your own question.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1969</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why would anyone want to kill a sleeping child?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1970</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How is my son, Maester?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1971</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Unchanged, my lady.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1972</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do you have the answer yet?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1973</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Someone is afraid Bran might wake up,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1974</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>afraid of what he might say or do, afraid of something he knows.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1975</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Very good.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1976</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We must keep Bran safe.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1977</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If there was one killer, there could be others.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1978</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How many guards do you want, rn&apos;lady?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1979</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So long as Lord Eddard is away, my son is the master of Winterfell,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1980</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Put one man in the sickroom, night and day, one outside the door, two at the bottom of the stairs.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1981</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No one sees Bran without my warrant or my mother&apos;s.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1982</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>As you say, m&apos;lord.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1983</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do it now,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1984</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And let his wolf stay in the room with him,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1985</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1986</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1987</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lady Stark,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1988</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>did you chance to notice the dagger the killer used?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1989</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The circumstances did not allow me to examine it closely, but I can vouch for its edge,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1990</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why do you ask?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1991</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We found the knife still in the villain&apos;s grasp.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1992</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It seemed to me that it was altogether too fine a weapon for such a man, so I looked at it long and hard.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1993</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The blade is Valyrian steel, the hilt dragonbone.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1994</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A weapon like that has no business being in the hands of such as him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1995</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Someone gave it to him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1996</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Robb, close the door.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1997</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What I am about to tell you must not leave this room,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1998</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I want your oaths on that.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1999</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If even part of what I suspect is true, Ned and my girls have ridden into deadly danger, and a word in the wrong ears could mean their lives.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2000</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Eddard is a second father to me,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2001</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I do so swear.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2002</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You have my oath,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2003</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And mine, my lady,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2004</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And you, Robb?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2005</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My sister Lysa believes the Lannisters murdered her husband, Lord Arryn, the Hand of the King,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2006</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It comes to me that Jaime Lannister did not join the hunt the day Bran fell.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2007</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He remained here in the castle.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2008</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I do not think Bran fell from that tower,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2009</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I think he was thrown.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2010</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My lady, that is a monstrous suggestion,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2011</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Even the Kingslayer would flinch at the murder of an innocent child.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2012</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, would he?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2013</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I wonder.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2014</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There is no limit to Lannister pride or Lannister ambition,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2015</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The boy had always been surehanded in the past,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2016</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He knew every stone in Winterfell.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>Gods,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2018</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If this is true, he will pay for it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2019</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ll kill him myself!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2020</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Put that away!</quotetext>

		<quotetext>My lady, if it comes to that, my House owes yours a great debt.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>This is the queen&apos;s beloved brother we mean to accuse.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2031</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She will not take it kindly.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>We must have proof, or forever keep silent.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2033</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your proof is in the dagger,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>No,</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>2038</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your place is here.</quotetext>

	<quote>

		<quotetext>There must always be a Stark in Winterfell.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>2040</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I must go myself.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>2041</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My lady,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2042</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>is that wise?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2043</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Surely the Lannisters would greet your arrival with suspicion.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2044</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What about Bran?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2045</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You can&apos;t mean to leave him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2046</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have done everything I can for Bran,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>His life is in the hands of the gods and Maester Luwin.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2049</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You will need a strong escort, my lady,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2050</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ll send Hal with a squad of guardsmen,</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>My lady, let me accompany you at least.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>The kingsroad can be perilous for a woman alone.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2056</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I will not be taking the kingsroad,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2057</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Two riders can move as fast as one, and a good deal faster than a long column burdened by wagons and wheelhouses.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2058</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I will welcome your company, Ser Rodrik.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2059</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We will follow the White Knife down to the sea, and hire a ship at White Harbor.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2060</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Strong horses and brisk winds should bring us to King&apos;s Landing well ahead of Ned and the Lannisters.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2061</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The king sent for him.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>Another hunt, I do believe.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>There are still wild aurochs in these lands, I am told.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>A noble lady does not feed dogs at her table,</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2066</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She&apos;s not a dog, she&apos;s a direwolf,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2067</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Anyway, Father said we could keep them with us if we want.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2068</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;re a good girl, Sansa, but I do vow, when it comes to that creature you&apos;re as willful as your sister Arya.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2069</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And where is Arya this morning?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2070</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She wasn&apos;t hungry,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2071</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do remind her to dress nicely today.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2072</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The grey velvet, perhaps.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>We are all invited to ride with the queen and Princess Myrcella in the royal wheelhouse, and we must look our best.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2074</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ll tell her,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2075</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>but she&apos;ll dress the way she always does.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2076</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>May I be excused?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2077</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You may.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2078</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You better put on something pretty,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2079</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Septa Mordane said so.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>We&apos;re traveling in the queen&apos;s wheelhouse with Princess Myrcella today.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2081</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m not,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2082</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Mycah and I are going to ride upstream and look for rubies at the ford.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2083</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Rubies,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2084</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What rubies?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2085</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Rhaegar&apos;s rubies.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2086</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This is where King Robert killed him and won the crown.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2087</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You can&apos;t look for rubies, the princess is expecting us.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2088</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The queen invited us both.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2089</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I don&apos;t care,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2090</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The wheelhouse doesn&apos;t even have windows, you can&apos;t see a thing.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2091</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What could you want to see?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2092</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s all just fields and farms and holdfasts.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2093</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It is not,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2094</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If you came with us sometimes, you&apos;d see.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2095</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I hate riding,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2096</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>All it does is get you soiled and dusty and sore.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2097</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Hold still,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2098</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m not hurting you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2099</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>When we were crossing the Neck, I counted thirty-six flowers I never saw before, and Mycah showed me a lizard-lion.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2100</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Last week we found this haunted watchtower, and the day before we chased a herd of wild horses.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2101</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You should have seen them run when they caught a scent of Nymeria.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2102</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Stop that, I have to do the other side, you&apos;re all muddy.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2103</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;re not supposed to leave the column,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2104</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Father said so.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2105</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I didn&apos;t go far.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2106</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Anyway, Nymeria was with me the whole time.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2107</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I don&apos;t always go off, either.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2108</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Sometimes it&apos;s fun just to ride along with the wagons and talk to people.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2109</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You have to come with me,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2110</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You can&apos;t refuse the queen.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2111</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Septa Mordane will expect you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2112</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Come back here!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2113</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There&apos;s going to be lemon cakes and tea,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2114</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why would you want to ride a smelly old horse and get all sore and sweaty when you could recline on feather pillows and eat cakes with the queen?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2115</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I don&apos;t like the queen,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2116</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She won&apos;t even let me bring Nymeria.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2117</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A royal wheelhouse is no place for a wolf,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2118</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And Princess Myrcella is afraid of them, you know that.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2119</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Myrcella is a little baby.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2120</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Bad wolf!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2121</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I don&apos;t care what you say, I&apos;m going out riding.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2122</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Gods be true, Arya, sometimes you act like such a child,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2123</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ll go by myself then.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2124</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It will be ever so much nicer that way.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2125</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lady and I will eat all the lemon cakes and just have the best time without you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2126</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They won&apos;t let you bring Lady either.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2127</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The council does us great honor, my good lords.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2128</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What&apos;s happening?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2129</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The council sent riders from King&apos;s Landing to escort us the rest of the way,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2130</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>An honor guard for the king.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2131</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The king is gone hunting, but I know he will be pleased to see you when he returns,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2132</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You are shaking, girl,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2133</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do I frighten you so much?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2134</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A wolf,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2135</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Seven hells, that&apos;s a direwolf,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2136</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What&apos;s it doing in camp?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2137</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Starks use them for wet nurses,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2138</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Joffrey, go to her.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2139</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Leave her alone,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2140</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What is it, sweet lady?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2141</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why are you afraid?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2142</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No one will hurt you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2143</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Put away your swords, all of you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2144</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The wolf is her little pet, that&apos;s all.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2145</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And you, dog, away with you, you&apos;re scaring my betrothed.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2146</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It was not him, my sweet prince,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2147</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It was the other one.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2148</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Payne?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2149</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ofttimes Ser Ilyn frightens me as well, sweet lady.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2150</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He has a fearsome aspect.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2151</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>As well he should.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2152</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If the wicked do not fear the Mng&apos;s Justice, you have put the wrong man in the office.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2153</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Then surely you have chosen the right one, Your Grace,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2154</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well spoken, child,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2155</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>As befits the daughter of Eddard Stark.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2156</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I am honored to know you, however irregular the manner of our meeting.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2157</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I am Ser Barristan Selmy, of the Kingsguard.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2158</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2159</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>and councillor to Robert our king and to Aerys Targaryen before him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2160</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The honor is mine, good knight.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2161</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Even in the far north, the singers praise the deeds of Barristan the Bold.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2162</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Barristan the Old, you mean.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2163</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Don&apos;t flatter him too sweetly, child, he thinks overmuch of himself already.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2164</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Now, wolf girl, if you can put a name to me as well, then I must concede that you are truly our Hand&apos;s daughter.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2165</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Have a care how you address my betrothed.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2166</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I can answer,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2167</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your helmet bears golden antlers, my lord.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2168</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The stag is the sigil of the royal House.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2169</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>King Robert has two brothers.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2170</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>By your extreme youth, you can only be Renly Baratheon, Lord of Storm&apos;s End and councillor to the king, and so I name you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2171</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>By his extreme youth, he can only be a prancing jackanapes, and so I name him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2172</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I am sorry if I offended you, Ser Ilyn,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2173</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Did I say something wrong, Your Grace?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2174</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why will he not speak to me?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2175</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ser Ilyn has not been feeling talkative these past fourteen years,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2176</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Aerys Targaryen had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2177</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He speaks most eloquently with his sword, however,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2178</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>and his devotion to our realm is unquestioned.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2179</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Sansa, the good councillors and I must speak together until the king returns with your father.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2180</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I fear we shall have to postpone your day with Myrcella.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2181</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Please give your sweet sister my apologies.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2182</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Joffrey, perhaps you would be so kind as to entertain our guest today.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2183</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It would be my pleasure, Mother,</quotetext>
	</quote>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2186</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We could go riding.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Oh, I love riding,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Your wolf is liable to frighten the horses, and my dog seems to frighten you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2189</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Let us leave them both behind and set off on our own, what do you say?</quotetext>

		<quotetext>My father only lets us have one cup, and only at feasts,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>That was where my father killed Rhaegar Targaryen, you know.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>He smashed in his chest, crunch, right through the armor.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>I am sorry, my lord,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2267</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The guards on the gate were Lannister men, and they informed the queen when Jory brought her in.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2268</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She&apos;s being taken directly before the kingâ€¦</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>2286</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I am sorry, Ned.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2287</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I never meant to frighten the girl.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2288</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It seemed best to bring her here and get the business done with quickly.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2289</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And what business is that?</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>That animal of hers tried to tear his arm off.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>2294</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That&apos;s not true,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2295</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She just bit him a little.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>2296</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He was hurting Mycah.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Joff told us what happened,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>That&apos;s not how it was,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Tell it all, and tell it true.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2307</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It is a great crime to lie to a king.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>2308</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>When she is done, you will have your turn.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2337</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So he will.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2338</quoteindex>

		<quotetext>Ned, see that your daughter is disciplined.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>That would be a fine trick, without a wolf.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>We have a wolf,</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>2356</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>As you will.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>A direwolf is a savage beast.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>Sooner or later it would have turned on your girl the same way the other did on my son.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Is this some trick?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2385</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why would you do such a thing?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2386</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She is of the north.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2387</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She deserves better than a butcher.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Lady,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Choose four men and have them take the body north.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Bury her at Winterfell.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>All that way?</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>2392</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>All that way,</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>2393</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Lannister woman shall never have this skin.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2394</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No sign of your daughter, Hand,</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>2395</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>but the day was not wholly wasted.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>2396</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We got her little pet.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2397</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You rode him down,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2398</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He ran.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2399</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But not very fast.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2400</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But I never fall,</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>2404</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Are you really a crow?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2405</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s just a dream,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>I&apos;ll wake up when I hit the ground,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>I&apos;m falling!</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>2412</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m afraidâ€¦</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2413</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2414</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Can a man still be brave if he&apos;s afraid?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2415</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That is the only time a man can be brave.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2416</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m flying!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2417</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What are you doing?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2418</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He&apos;s awake, he&apos;s awake, he&apos;s awake.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2419</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>His name is Summer,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2420</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We will make King&apos;s Landing within the hour.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2421</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your oarmen have done well by us, Captain.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2422</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Each one of them shall have a silver stag, as a token of my gratitude.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2423</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You are far too generous, Lady Stark.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2424</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The honor of carrying a great lady like yourself is all the reward they need.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2425</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But they&apos;ll take the silver anyway.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2426</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>As you say.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2427</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My good friend,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2428</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It is so fine to see you looking better.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2429</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2430</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I haven&apos;t wanted to die for almost two days now.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2431</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My lady.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2432</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The captain was just telling me that our voyage is almost at an end,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2433</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So soon?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2434</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I will leave you to discuss your business,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2435</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have not been the most valiant of protectors.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2436</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We are here, Ser Rodrik, and safely.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2437</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That is all that truly matters.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2438</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Now we must reach the king&apos;s master-at-arms, and pray that he can be trusted.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2439</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ser Aron Santagar is a vain man, but an honest one.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2440</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He may know the blade, yesâ€¦ but, my lady, the moment we go ashore we are at risk.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2441</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And there are those at court who will know you on sight.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2442</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Littlefinger,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2443</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Baelish once, ahâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2444</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He was my father&apos;s ward.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2445</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We grew up together in Riverrun.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2446</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I thought of him as a brother, but his feelings for me wereâ€¦ more than brotherly.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2447</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>When it was announced that I was to wed Brandon Stark, Petyr challenged for the right to my hand.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2448</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It was madness.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2449</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Brandon was twenty, Petyr scarcely fifteen.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2450</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I had to beg Brandon to spare Petyr&apos;s life.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2451</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He let him off with a scar.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2452</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Afterward my father sent him away.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2453</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have not seen him since.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2454</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He wrote to me at Riverrun after Brandon was killed, but I burned the letter unread.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2455</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>By then I knew that Ned would marry me in his brother&apos;s place.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2456</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Littlefinger sits on the small council now.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2457</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I knew he would rise high,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2458</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He was always clever, even as a boy, but it is one thing to be clever and another to be wise.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2459</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I wonder what the years have done to him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2460</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My lady,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2461</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have thought on how best to proceed while I lay abed.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2462</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You must not enter the castle.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2463</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I will go in your stead and bring Ser Aron to you in some safe place.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2464</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You would be as much at risk as I would.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2465</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I think not.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2466</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I looked at my reflection in the water earlier and scarcely recognized myself.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2467</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My mother was the last person to see me without whiskers, and she is forty years dead.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2468</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I believe I am safe enough, my lady.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2469</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>King&apos;s Landing, my lady, as you did command, and never has a ship made a swifter or surer passage.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2470</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Will you be needing assistance to carry your things to the castle?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2471</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We shall not be going to the castle.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2472</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Perhaps you can suggest an inn, someplace clean and comfortable and not too far from the river.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2473</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Just so.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2474</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I know of several establishments that might suit your needs.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2475</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yet first, if I may be so bold, there is the matter of the second half of the payment we agreed upon.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2476</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And of course the extra silver you were so kind as to promise.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2477</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Sixty stags, I believe it was.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2478</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>For the oarmen,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2479</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, of a certainty,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2480</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Though perhaps I should hold it for them until we return to Tyrosh.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2481</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>For the sake of their wives and children.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2482</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If you give them the silver here, my lady, they will dice it away or spend it all for a night&apos;s pleasure.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2483</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There are worse things to spend money on,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2484</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Winter is coming.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2485</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A man must make his own choices,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2486</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They earned the silver.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2487</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How they spend it is no concern of mine.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2488</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>As you say, my lady,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2489</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I think it best if you stay away from the common room,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2490</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Even in a place like this, one never knows who may be watching.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2491</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I will be back before nightfall, with Ser Aron,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2492</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Rest now, my lady.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2493</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Open, in the name of the king.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2494</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A moment,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2495</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No need for that, m&apos;lady.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2496</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We&apos;re to escort you to the castle.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2497</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>By whose authority?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2498</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Petyr,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2499</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do you know who I am?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2500</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No, m&apos;lady,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2501</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>M&apos;lord Littlefinger said only to bring you to him, and see that you were not mistreated.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2502</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You may wait outside while I dress.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2503</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Cat,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2504</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why have I been brought here in this fashion?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2505</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Leave us.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2506</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You were not mistreated, I trust,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2507</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I gave firm instructions.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2508</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your handsâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2509</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I am not accustomed to being summoned like a serving wench,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2510</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>As a boy, you still knew the meaning of courtesy.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2511</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ve angered you, my lady.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2512</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That was never my intent.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2513</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How did you know I was in the city?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2514</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Varys knows all,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2515</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He will be joining us shortly, but I wanted to see you alone first.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2516</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It has been too long, Cat.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2517</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How many years?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2518</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So it was the King&apos;s Spider who found me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2519</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You don&apos;t want to call him that.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2520</quoteindex>

		<quotetext>Nothing happens in this city without Varys knowing.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2523</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oftimes he knows about it before it happens.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2524</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He has informants everywhere.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2525</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>His little birds, he calls them.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2526</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>One of his little birds heard about your visit.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2527</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Thankfully, Varys came to me first.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2528</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why you?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2529</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why not me?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2530</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I am master of coin, the king&apos;s own councillor.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>2531</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Selmy and Lord Renly rode north to meet Robert, and Lord Stannis is gone to Dragonstone, leaving only Maester Pycelle and me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2532</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I was the obvious choice.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2533</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I was ever a friend to your sister Lysa, Varys knows that.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2534</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Does Varys know aboutâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2535</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Varys knows everythingâ€¦ except why you are here.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2536</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why are you here?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2537</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A wife is allowed to yearn for her husband, and if a mother needs her daughters close, who can tell her no?</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2538</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, very good, my lady, but please don&apos;t expect me to believe that.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>I know you too well.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>2541</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Family, Duty, Honor,</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>Family, Duty, Honor,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2543</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>All of which required you to remain in Winterfell, where our Hand left you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2544</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No, my lady, something has happened.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2545</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This sudden trip of yours bespeaks a certain urgency.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2546</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I beg of you, let me help.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2547</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Old sweet friends should never hesitate to rely upon each other.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2548</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Enter,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2549</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lady Stark,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2550</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>to see you again after so many years is such a joy.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2551</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, your poor hands.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2552</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Have you burned yourself, sweet lady?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2553</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The fingers are so delicateâ€¦ Our good Maester Pycelle makes a marvelous salve, shall I send for a jar?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2554</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I thank you, my lord, but my own Maester Luwin has already seen to my hurts.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2555</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I was grievous sad to hear about your son.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2556</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And him so young.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2557</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The gods are cruel.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2558</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>On that we agree, Lord Varys,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2559</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>On more than that, I hope, sweet lady.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2560</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have great esteem for your husband, our new Hand, and I know we do both love King Robert.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2561</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2562</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>For a certainty.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2563</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Never has a king been so beloved as our Robert,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2564</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>At least in Lord Varys&apos;s hearing.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2565</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Good lady,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2566</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There are men in the Free Cities with wondrous healing powers.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2567</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Say only the word, and I will send for one for your dear Bran.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2568</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Maester Luwin is doing all that can be done for Bran,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2569</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Baelish tells me that I have you to thank for bringing me here.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2570</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, yes.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2571</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I suppose I am guilty.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2572</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I hope you forgive me, kind lady.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2573</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I wonder if we might trouble you to show us the dagger?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2574</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What have you done to Ser Rodrik?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2575</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I feel rather like the knight who arrives at the battle without his lance.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2576</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What dagger are we talking about?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2577</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Who is Ser Rodrik?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2578</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ser Rodrik Cassel is master-at-arms at Winterfell,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2579</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I assure you, Lady Stark, nothing at all has been done to the good knight.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2580</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He did call here early this afternoon.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2581</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He visited with Ser Aron Santagar in the armory, and they talked of a certain dagger.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2582</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>About sunset, they left the castle together and walked to that dreadful hovel where you were staying.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2583</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They are still there, drinking in the common room, waiting for your return.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2584</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ser Rodrik was very distressed to find you gone.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2585</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How could you know all that?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2586</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The whisperings of little birds,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2587</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I know things, sweet lady.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2588</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That is the nature of my service.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2589</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You do have the dagger with you, yes?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2590</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Here.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2591</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Perhaps your little birds will whisper the name of the man it belongs to.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2592</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Careful,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2593</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>it&apos;s sharp.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2594</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Nothing holds an edge like Valyrian steel,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2595</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Such sweet balance.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2596</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You want to find the owner, is that the reason for this visit?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2597</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You have no need of Ser Aron for that, my lady.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2598</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You should have come to me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2599</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And if I had,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2600</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>what would you have told me?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2601</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I would have told you that there was only one knife like this at King&apos;s Landing.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2602</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s mine.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2603</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yours?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2604</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Until the tourney on Prince Joffrey&apos;s name day,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2605</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I backed Ser Jaime in the jousting, along with half the court.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2606</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>When Loras Tyrell unhorsed him, many of us became a trifle poorer.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2607</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ser Jaime lost a hundred golden dragons, the queen lost an emerald pendant, and I lost my knife.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2608</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Her Grace got the emerald back, but the winner kept the rest.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2609</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Who?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2610</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Imp,</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>2611</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Tyrion Lannister.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2612</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Enough!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2613</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The bastard broke my wrist.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2614</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The bastard hamstrung you, opened your empty skull, and cut off your hand.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2615</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Or would have, if these blades had an edge.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2616</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s fortunate for you that the Watch needs stableboys as well as rangers.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2617</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Get the Aurochs on his feet, he has funeral arrangements to make.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2618</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That is a longsword, not an old man&apos;s cane,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2619</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Are your legs hurting, Lord Snow?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2620</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2621</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The truth now,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2622</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m tired,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2623</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What you are is weak.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2624</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I won.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2625</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2626</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Aurochs lost.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2627</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That will be all,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2628</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I can only stomach so much ineptitude in any one day.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2629</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If the Others ever come for us, I pray they have archers, because you lot are fit for nothing more than arrow fodder.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>This is not Winterfell,</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>2633</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ll be fifteen on my name day,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Almost a man grown.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2635</quoteindex>

		<quoteindex>2636</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If you thought your Stark blood would win you easy favors, you were wrong.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>We put aside our old families when we swear our vows.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Your father will always have a place in my heart, but these are my brothers now.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>How often must I tell you no, Jon?</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>2645</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Try.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2646</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You make us look bad,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2647</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You looked bad before I ever met you,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>The little lordling has a mouth on him,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>What was she, some whore?</quotetext>

		<quotetext>You won&apos;t like that.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>He broke my wrist,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2662</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A bruise.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2663</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Perhaps a sprain.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2664</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Maester Aemon will give you a salve.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>Even men like Toad.</quotetext>

	<quote>

		<quotetext>They were the ones who came after me.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>You leave them nothing.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>2721</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Does that make you proud?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2722</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They&apos;re all older than me,</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>2723</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Older and bigger and stronger, that&apos;s the truth.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2724</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ll wager your master-at-arms taught you how to fight bigger men at Winterfell, though.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2725</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Who was he, some old knight?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2726</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ser Rodrik Cassel,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2727</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Now think on this, boy.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2728</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>None of these others have ever had a master-at-arms until Ser Alliser.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2729</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Their fathers were farmers and wagonmen and poachers, smiths and miners and oars on a trading galley.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2730</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What they know of fighting they learned between decks, in the alleys of Oldtown and Lannisport, in wayside brothels and taverns on the kingsroad.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2731</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They may have clacked a few sticks together before they came here, but I promise you, not one in twenty was ever rich enough to own a real sword.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2732</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So how do you like the taste of your victories now, Lord Snow?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2733</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Don&apos;t call me that!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2734</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I neverâ€¦ I didn&apos;t thinkâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2735</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Best you start thinking,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2736</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That, or sleep with a dagger by your bed.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2737</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Now go.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2738</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And beyond a doubt the most useless,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2739</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Makes you wonder what lies beyond,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2740</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lannister.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2741</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I didn&apos;t seeâ€”I mean, I thought I was alone.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>2742</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There&apos;s much to be said for taking people unawares.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2743</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You never know what you might learn.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2744</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You won&apos;t learn anything from me,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2745</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, I learn things everywhere I go.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2746</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>As I was sayingâ€¦ why is it that when one man builds a wall, the next man immediately needs to know what&apos;s on the other side?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2747</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You do want to know what&apos;s on the other side, don&apos;t you?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2748</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s nothing special,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2749</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The rangers say it&apos;s just woods and mountains and frozen lakes, with lots of snow and ice.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2750</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And the grumkins and the snarks,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2751</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Let us not forget them, Lord Snow, or else what&apos;s that big thing for?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2752</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Don&apos;t call me Lord Snow.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2753</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Would you rather be called the Imp?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2754</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Let them see that their words can cut you, and you&apos;ll never be free of the mockery.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2755</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If they want to give you a name, take it, make it your own.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2756</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Then they can&apos;t hurt you with it anymore.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2757</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Come, walk with me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2758</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They&apos;ll be serving some vile stew in the common hall by now, and I could do with a bowl of something hot.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2759</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I don&apos;t see your wolf,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2760</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I chain him up in the old stables when we&apos;re training.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2761</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They board all the horses in the east stables now, so no one bothers him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2762</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The rest of the time he stays with me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2763</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My sleeping cell is in Hardin&apos;s Tower.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2764</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That&apos;s the one with the broken battlement, no?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2765</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Shattered stone in the yard below, and a lean to it like our noble king Robert after a long night&apos;s drinking?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2766</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I thought all those buildings had been abandoned.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2767</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No one cares where you sleep.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2768</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Most of the old keeps are empty, you can pick any cell you want.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2769</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ll be sure to tell your father to arrest more stonemasons, before your tower collapses.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2770</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s better that I&apos;m by myself,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2771</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The rest of them are scared of Ghost.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2772</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Wise boys,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2773</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The talk is, your uncle is too long away.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2774</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He said he&apos;d be back by my name day,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2775</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They were looking for Ser Waymar Royce, his father is bannerman to Lord Arryn.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2776</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Uncle Benjen said they might search as far as the Shadow Tower.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2777</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That&apos;s all the way up in the mountains.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2778</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I hear that a good many rangers have vanished of late,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2779</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Perhaps the grumkins are hungry this year.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2780</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Barley, onion, carrot,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2781</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Someone should tell the cooks that turnip isn&apos;t a meat.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2782</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s mutton stew.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2783</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Snow.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2784</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Lord Commander wants to see you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2785</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Now.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2786</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Is it my uncle?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2787</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Is he returned safe?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2788</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Lord Commander is not accustomed to waiting,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2789</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And I am not accustomed to having my commands questioned by bastards.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2790</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Stop it, Thorne.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2791</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;re frightening the boy.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2792</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Keep out of matters that don&apos;t concern you, Lannister.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2793</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You have no place here.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2794</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have a place at court, though,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2795</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A word in the right ear, and you&apos;ll die a sour old man before you get another boy to train.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2796</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Now tell Snow why the Old Bear needs to see him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2797</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Is there news of his uncle?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2798</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>This is another matter entirely.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>A bird arrived this morning from Winterfell, with a message that concerns his brother.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>The gods gave him back.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>It hurt like seven hells, but yours must be worse.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Look, if you want, I can show you how to defend that.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Lord Snow wants to take my place now.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2828</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;d have an easier time teaching a wolf to juggle than you will training this aurochs.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2829</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ll take that wager, Ser Alliser,</quotetext>

	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2850</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your gods have heard you,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2851</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The prince grows stronger every day.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2852</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I see you have arrived safely, Lord Stark,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2853</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And you as well,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2854</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You must forgive me, but sometimes you look the very image of your brother Robert.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2855</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A poor copy,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2856</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Though much better dressed,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2857</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Renly spends more on clothing than half the ladies of the court.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2858</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There are worse crimes,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2859</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The way you dress, for one.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2860</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have hoped to meet you for some years, Lord Stark.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2861</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me to you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2862</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She has,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2863</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I understand you knew my brother Brandon as well.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2864</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Rather too well,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2865</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I still carry a token of his esteem.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2866</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Did Brandon speak of me too?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2867</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Often, and with some heat,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2868</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I should have thought that heat ill suits you Starks,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2869</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Here in the south, they say you are all made of ice, and melt when you ride below the Neck.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2870</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I do not plan on melting soon, Lord Baelish.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2871</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You may count on it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2872</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Maester Pycelle, I trust you are well.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2873</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well enough for a man of my years, my lord,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2874</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>yet I do tire easily, I fear.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2875</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Perhaps we might begin soon,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2876</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I fear I shall fall asleep if we wait much longer.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2877</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>As you will.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2878</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My lords,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2879</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I am sorry to have kept you waiting.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2880</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You are the King&apos;s Hand,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2881</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We serve at your pleasure, Lord Stark.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2882</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We are but five,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2883</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Stannis took himself to Dragonstone not long after the king went north,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2884</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>and our gallant Ser Barristan no doubt rides beside the king as he makes his way through the city, as befits the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2885</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Perhaps we had best wait for Ser Barristan and the king to join us,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2886</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If we wait for my brother to grace us with his royal presence, it could be a long sit.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2887</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Our good King Robert has many cares,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2888</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He entrusts some small matters to us, to lighten his load.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2889</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What Lord Varys means is that all this business of coin and crops and justice bores my royal brother to tears,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2890</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>so it falls to us to govern the realm.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2891</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He does send us a command from time to time.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2892</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This morning he commanded me to ride ahead with all haste and ask Grand Maester Pycelle to convene this council at once.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2893</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He has an urgent task for us.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2894</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Gods be good,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2895</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What Lord Eddard means to say,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2896</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>is that His Grace instructs us to stage a great tournament in honor of his appointment as the Hand of the King.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2897</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How much?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2898</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Forty thousand golden dragons to the champion.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2899</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Twenty thousand to the man who comes second, another twenty to the winner of the melee, and ten thousand to the victor of the archery competition.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2900</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ninety thousand gold pieces,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2901</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And we must not neglect the other costs.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2902</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Robert will want a prodigious feast.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2903</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That means cooks, carpenters, serving girls, singers, jugglers, foolsâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2904</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Fools we have in plenty,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2905</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Will the treasury bear the expense?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2906</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What treasury is that?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2907</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Spare me the foolishness, Maester.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2908</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You know as well as I that the treasury has been empty for years.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2909</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I shall have to borrow the money.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2910</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No doubt the Lannisters will be accommodating.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2911</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We owe Lord Tywin some three million dragons at present, what matter another hundred thousand?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2912</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Are you claiming that the Crown is three million gold pieces in debt?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2913</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Crown is more than six million gold pieces in debt, Lord Stark.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2914</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Lannisters are the biggest part of it, but we have also borrowed from Lord Tyrell, the Iron Bank of Braavos, and several Tyroshi trading cartels.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2915</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Of late I&apos;ve had to turn to the Faith.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2916</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The High Septon haggles worse than a Dornish fishmonger.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2917</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Aerys Targaryen left a treasury flowing with gold.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2918</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How could you let this happen?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2919</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The master of coin finds the money.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2920</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The king and the Hand spend it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2921</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I will not believe that Jon Arryn allowed Robert to beggar the realm,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2922</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Arryn was a prudent man, but I fear that His Grace does not always listen to wise counsel.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2923</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My royal brother loves tournaments and feasts,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2924</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>and he loathes what he calls â€˜counting coppers.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2925</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I will speak with His Grace,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2926</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This tourney is an extravagance the realm cannot afford.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2927</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Speak to him as you will,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2928</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>we had still best make our plans.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2929</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Another day,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2930</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Forgive me, my lords,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2931</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I am tired.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2932</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Let us call a halt for today and resume when we are fresher.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2933</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;re going the wrong way, Stark.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2934</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Come with me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2935</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This is not the way to my chambers,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2936</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Did I say it was?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2937</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m leading you to the dungeons to slit your throat and seal your corpse up behind a wall,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2938</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We have no time for this, Stark.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2939</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your wife awaits.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2940</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What game are you playing, Littlefinger?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2941</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Catelyn is at Winterfell, hundreds of leagues from here.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2942</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2943</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Then it appears someone has managed an astonishing impersonation.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2944</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>For the last time, come.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2945</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Or don&apos;t come, and I&apos;ll keep her for myself.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2946</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We&apos;re outside the castle,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2947</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You are a hard man to fool, Stark,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2948</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Was it the sun that gave it away, or the sky?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2949</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Follow me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2950</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There are niches cut in the rock.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2951</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Try not to fall to your death, Catelyn would never understand.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2952</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You are growing old and slow, Stark,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2953</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No matter, we ride the rest of the way.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2954</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A brothel,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2955</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;ve brought me all this way to take me to a brothel.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2956</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your wife is inside,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2957</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Brandon was too kind to you,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2958</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My lord, no,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2959</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He speaks the truth.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2960</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This is no business of yours,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2961</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ser Rodrik?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2962</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your lady awaits you upstairs.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2963</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Catelyn is truly here?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2964</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This is not some strange jape of Littlefinger&apos;s?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2965</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Would that it were, Stark,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2966</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Follow me, and try to look a shade more lecherous and a shade less like the King&apos;s Hand.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2967</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It would not do to have you recognized.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2968</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Perhaps you could fondle a breast or two, just in passing.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2969</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My lady,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2970</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, very good,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2971</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You recognized her.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2972</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I feared you&apos;d never come, my lord,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2973</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Petyr has been bringing me reports.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2974</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He told me of your troubles with Arya and the young prince.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2975</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How are my girls?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2976</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Both in mourning, and full of anger,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2977</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Cat, I do not understand.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2978</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What are you doing in King&apos;s Landing?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2979</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What&apos;s happened?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2980</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Is it Bran?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2981</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Is heâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2982</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It is Bran, but not as you think,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2983</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Then how?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2984</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why are you here, my love?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2985</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What is this place?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2986</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Just what it appears,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2987</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A brothel.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2988</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Can you think of a less likely place to find a Catelyn Tully?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2989</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>As it chances, I own this particular establishment, so arrangements were easily made.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2990</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I am most anxious to keep the Lannisters from learning that Cat is here in King&apos;s Landing.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2991</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2992</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;ve been hurt.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2993</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Gods.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2994</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Those are deep cutsâ€¦ a gash from a sword orâ€¦ how did this happen, my lady?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2995</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This blade was sent to open Bran&apos;s throat and spill his life&apos;s blood.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2996</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Butâ€¦ whoâ€¦ why wouldâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2997</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Let me tell it all, my love.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2998</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It will go faster that way.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2999</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Listen.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3000</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Imp&apos;s dagger,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3001</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why should Tyrion Lannister want Bran dead?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3002</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The boy has never done him harm.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3003</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do you Starks have nought but snow between your ears?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3004</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Imp would never have acted alone.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3005</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If the queen had a role in this or, gods forbid, the king himselfâ€¦ no, I will not believe that.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3006</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Most likely the king did not know,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3007</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It would not be the first time.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3008</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Our good Robert is practiced at closing his eyes to things he would rather not see.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3009</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The accusation is treason either way.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3010</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Accuse the king and you will dance with Ilyn Payne before the words are out of your mouth.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3011</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The queenâ€¦ if you can find proof, and if you can make Robert listen, then perhapsâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3012</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We have proof,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3013</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We have the dagger.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3014</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This?</quotetext>

		<quotetext>A sweet piece of steel, but it cuts two ways, my lord.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3016</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Imp will no doubt swear the blade was lost or stolen while he was at Winterfell, and with his hireling dead, who is there to give him the lie?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3017</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My counsel is to drop that in the river and forget that it was ever forged.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3018</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Baelish, I am a Stark of Winterfell.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3019</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My son lies crippled, perhaps dying.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3020</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He would be dead, and Catelyn with him, but for a wolf pup we found in the snow.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3021</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If you truly believe I could forget that, you are as big a fool now as when you took up sword against my brother.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3022</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A fool I may be, Starkâ€¦ yet I&apos;m still here, while your brother has been moldering in his frozen grave for some fourteen years now.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3023</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If you are so eager to molder beside him, far be it from me to dissuade you, but I would rather not be included in the party, thank you very much.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3024</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You would be the last man I would willingly include in any party, Lord Baelish.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3025</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You wound me deeply.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3026</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>For my part, I always found you Starks a tiresome lot, but Cat seems to have become attached to you, for reasons I cannot comprehend.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3027</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I shall try to keep you alive for her sake.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3028</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A fool&apos;s task, admittedly, but I could never refuse your wife anything.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3029</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I told Petyr our suspicions about Jon Arryn&apos;s death,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3030</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He has promised to help you find the truth.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3031</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Very well,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3032</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You spoke of Varys.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3033</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Does the eunuch know all of it?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3034</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Not from my lips,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3035</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You did not wed a fool, Eddard Stark.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3036</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But Varys has ways of learning things that no man could know.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3037</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He has some dark art, Ned, I swear it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3038</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He has spies, that is well known,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3039</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It is more than that,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3040</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ser Rodrik spoke to Ser Aron Santagar in all secrecy, yet somehow the Spider knew of their conversation.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3041</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I fear that man.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3042</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Leave Lord Varys to me, sweet lady.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3043</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If you will permit me a small obscenityâ€”and where better for itâ€”I hold the man&apos;s balls in the palm of my hand.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3044</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Or would, if he were a man, or had any balls.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3045</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You see, if the pie is opened, the birds begin to sing, and Varys would not like that.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3046</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Were I you, I would worry more about the Lannisters and less about the eunuch.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3047</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My lady,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3048</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>there is nothing more you can do here.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3049</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I want you to return to Winterfell at once.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3050</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If there was one assassin, there could be others.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3051</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Whoever ordered Bran&apos;s death will learn soon enough that the boy still lives.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3052</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I had hoped to see the girlsâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3053</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That would be most unwise,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3054</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Red Keep is full of curious eyes, and children talk.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3055</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He speaks truly, my love,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3056</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Take Ser Rodrik and ride for Winterfell.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3057</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I will watch over the girls.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3058</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Go home to our sons and keep them safe.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3059</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>As you say, my lord.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3060</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Would the lord and lady like the use of a bedchamber?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3061</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I should warn you, Stark, we usually charge for that sort of thing around here.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3062</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A moment alone, that&apos;s all I ask,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3063</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Very well.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3064</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Don&apos;t be too long.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3065</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It is past time the Hand and I returned to the castle, before our absence is noted.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3066</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I will not forget the help you gave me, Petyr.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3067</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>When your men came for me, I did not know whether they were taking me to a friend or an enemy.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3068</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have found you more than a friend.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3069</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have found a brother I&apos;d thought lost.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3070</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I am desperately sentimental, sweet lady.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3071</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Best not tell anyone.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3072</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have spent years convincing the court that I am wicked and cruel, and I should hate to see all that hard work go for naught.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3073</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You have my thanks as well, Lord Baelish.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3074</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, now there&apos;s a treasure,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3075</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Once you are home, send word to Helman Tallhart and Galbart Glover under my seal.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3076</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They are to raise a hundred bowmen each and fortify Moat Cailin.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3077</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Two hundred determined archers can hold the Neck against an army.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3078</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Instruct Lord Manderly that he is to strengthen and repair all his defenses at White Harbor, and see that they are well manned.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3079</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And from this day on, I want a careful watch kept over Theon Greyjoy.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3080</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If there is war, we shall have sore need of his father&apos;s fleet.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3081</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>War?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3082</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It will not come to that,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3083</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Lannisters are merciless in the face of weakness, as Aerys Targaryen learned to his sorrow, but they would not dare attack the north without all the power of the realm behind them, and that they shall not have.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3084</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I must play out this fool&apos;s masquerade as if nothing is amiss.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3085</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Remember why I came here, my love.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3086</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If I find proof that the Lannisters murdered Jon Arrynâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3087</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3088</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>what then, my love?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3089</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>All justice flows from the king,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3090</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>When I know the truth, I must go to Robert.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3091</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Are you certain that you must leave us so soon?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3092</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Past certain, Lord Mormont,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3093</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My brother Jaime will be wondering what has become of me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3094</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He may decide that you have convinced me to take the black.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3095</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Would that I could.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3096</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;re a cunning man, Tyrion.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3097</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We have need of men of your sort on the Wall.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3098</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Then I shall scour the Seven Kingdoms for dwarfs and ship them all to you, Lord Mormont.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3099</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lannister mocks us.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3100</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Only you, Ser Alliser,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3101</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You have a bold tongue for someone who is less than half a man.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3102</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Perhaps you and I should visit the yard together.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3103</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3104</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The crabs are here.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3105</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Come and make your japes with steel in your hand.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3106</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why, I have steel in my hand, Ser Alliser, although it appears to be a crab fork.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3107</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Shall we duel?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3108</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Duel!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3109</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Duel!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3110</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Duel!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3111</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>To the victor goes the spoils,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3112</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I claim Thorne&apos;s share of the crabs.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3113</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You are a wicked man, to provoke our Ser Alliser so,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3114</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If a man paints a target on his chest, he should expect that sooner or later someone will loose an arrow at him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3115</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have seen dead men with more humor than your Ser Alliser.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3116</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Not so,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3117</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You ought to hear the droll names he gives the lads he trains.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3118</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ll wager the lads have a few names for him as well,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3119</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Chip the ice off your eyes, my good lords.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3120</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ser Alliser Thorne should be mucking out your stables, not drilling your young warriors.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3121</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Watch has no shortage of stableboys,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3122</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That seems to be all they send us these days.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3123</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Stableboys and sneak thieves and rapers.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3124</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ser Alliser is an anointed knight, one of the few to take the black since I have been Lord Commander.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3125</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He fought bravely at King&apos;s Landing.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3126</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>On the wrong side,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3127</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I ought to know, I was there on the battlements beside him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3128</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Tywin Lannister gave us a splendid choice.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3129</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Take the black, or see our heads on spikes before evenfall.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3130</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No offense intended, Tyrion.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3131</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>None taken, Ser Jaremy.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3132</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My father is very fond of spiked heads, especially those of people who have annoyed him in some fashion.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3133</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And a face as noble as yours, well, no doubt he saw you decorating the city wall above the King&apos;s Gate.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3134</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I think you would have looked very striking up there.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3135</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Thank you,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3136</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Sometimes I fear Ser Alliser saw you true, Tyrion.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3137</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You do mock us and our noble purpose here.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3138</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We all need to be mocked from time to time, Lord Mormont, lest we start to take ourselves too seriously.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3139</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>More wine, please.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3140</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You have a great thirst for a small man.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3141</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, I think that Lord Tyrion is quite a large man,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3142</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I think he is a giant come among us, here at the end of the world.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3143</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ve been called many things, my lord, but giant is seldom one of them.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3144</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Nonetheless,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3145</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I think it is true.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3146</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You are too kind, Maester Aemon.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3147</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have been called many things, my lord,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3148</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>but kind is seldom one of them.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3149</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The kingsroad can be perilous this far north,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3150</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have Jyck and Morrec,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3151</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>and Yoren is riding south again.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3152</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yoren is only one man.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3153</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Watch shall escort you as far as Winterfell,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3154</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Three men should be sufficient.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3155</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If you insist, my lord,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3156</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You might send young Snow.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3157</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He would be glad for a chance to see his brothers.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3158</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Snow?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3159</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, the Stark bastard.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3160</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I think not.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3161</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The young ones need to forget the lives they left behind them, the brothers and mothers and all that.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3162</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A visit home would only stir up feelings best left alone.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3163</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I know these things.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>My own blood kinâ€¦ my sister Maege rules Bear Island now, since my son&apos;s dishonor.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>I have nieces I have never seen.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Besides, Jon Snow is only a boy.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>You shall have three strong swords, to keep you safe.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>The Night&apos;s Watch is dying.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3177</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Our strength is less than a thousand now.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3178</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Six hundred here, two hundred in the Shadow Tower, even fewer at Eastwatch, and a scant third of those fighting men.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3179</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Wall is a hundred leagues long.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3180</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Think on that.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3181</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Should an attack come, I have three men to defend each mile of wall.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>Three and a third,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3183</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I sent Benjen Stark to search after Yohn Royce&apos;s son, lost on his first ranging.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3184</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Royce boy was green as summer grass, yet he insisted on the honor of his own command, saying it was his due as a knight.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3185</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I did not wish to offend his lord father, so I yielded.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3186</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I sent him out with two men I deemed as good as any in the Watch.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>3187</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>More fool I.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Gared was near as old as I am and longer on the Wall,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>yet it would seem he forswore himself and fled.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>I should never have believed it, not of him, but Lord Eddard sent me his head from Winterfell.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Of Royce, there is no word.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>One deserter and two men lost, and now Ben Stark too has gone missing.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Who am I to send searching after him?</quotetext>

		<quotetext>In two years I will be seventy.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>The Night&apos;s Watch has become an army of sullen boys and tired old men.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3202</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Apart from the men at my table tonight, I have perhaps twenty who can read, and even fewer who can think, or plan, or lead.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3203</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Once the Watch spent its summers building, and each Lord Commander raised the Wall higher than he found it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3204</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Now it is all we can do to stay alive.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3205</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I promise, the king will hear of your need,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>and I will speak to my father and my brother Jaime as well.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>You are a young man, Tyrion,</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>3208</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How many winters have you seen?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3209</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Eight, nine.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3210</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I misremember.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>When I was a boy, it was said that a long summer always meant a long winter to come.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3214</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This summer has lasted nine years, Tyrion, and a tenth will soon be upon us.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3215</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Think on that.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3216</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>When I was a boy,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3217</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>my wet nurse told me that one day, if men were good, the gods would give the world a summer without ending.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3218</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Perhaps we&apos;ve been better than we thought, and the Great Summer is finally at hand.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3219</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You are not fool enough to believe that, my lord.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>There can be no mistake, Aemon has had letters from the Citadel, findings in accord with his own.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>You must make them understand.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>They are running, my lordâ€¦ but running from what?</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>These are old bones, Lannister, but they have never felt a chill like this.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Tell the king what I say, I pray you.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>3238</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Tell them, Tyrion.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>A last look.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>3251</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Hello, Ghost.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3252</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lannister,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3253</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This is the last place I would have expected to see you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3254</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This is the last place I would have expected to be seen,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3255</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I was captured by a whim.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3256</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If I touch Ghost, will he chew my hand off?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3257</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Not with me here,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3258</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What are you doing up here tonight?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3259</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Besides freezing your manhood offâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3260</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have drawn night guard,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3261</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Again.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3262</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ser Alliser has kindly arranged for the watch commander to take a special interest in me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3263</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He seems to think that if they keep me awake half the night, I&apos;ll fall asleep during morning drill.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3264</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So far I have disappointed him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3265</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And has Ghost learned to juggle yet?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3266</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3267</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>but Grenn held his own against Halder this morning, and Pyp is no longer dropping his sword quite so often as he did.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3268</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Pyp?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3269</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Pypar is his real name.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3270</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The small boy with the large ears.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3271</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He saw me working with Grenn and asked for help.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3272</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Thorne had never even shown him the proper way to grip a sword.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3273</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have a mile of Wall to guard.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3274</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Will you walk with me?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3275</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If you walk slowly,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3276</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The watch commander tells me I must walk, to keep my blood from freezing, but he never said how fast.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3277</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I leave on the morrow,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3278</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I know.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3279</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I plan to stop at Winterfell on the way south.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3280</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If there is any message that you would like me to deliverâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3281</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Tell Robb that I&apos;m going to command the Night&apos;s Watch and keep him safe, so he might as well take up needlework with the girls and have Mikken melt down his sword for horseshoes.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3282</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your brother is bigger than me,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3283</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I decline to deliver any message that might get me killed.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3284</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Rickon will ask when I&apos;m coming home.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3285</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Try to explain where I&apos;ve gone, if you can.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3286</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Tell him he can have all my things while I&apos;m away, he&apos;ll like that.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3287</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You could put all this in a letter, you know.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3288</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Rickon can&apos;t read yet.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3289</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Branâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3290</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I don&apos;t know what message to send to Bran.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3291</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Help him, Tyrion.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3292</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What help could I give him?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3293</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I am no maester, to ease his pain.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3294</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have no spells to give him back his legs.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3295</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You gave me help when I needed it,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3296</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I gave you nothing,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3297</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Words.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3298</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Then give your words to Bran too.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3299</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;re asking a lame man to teach a cripple how to dance,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3300</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>However sincere the lesson, the result is likely to be grotesque.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3301</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Still, I know what it is to love a brother, Lord Snow.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3302</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I will give Bran whatever small help is in my power.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3303</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Thank you, my lord of Lannister.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3304</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Friend.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3305</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Most of my kin are bastards,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3306</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>but you&apos;re the first I&apos;ve had to friend.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3307</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My uncle is out there,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3308</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The first night they sent me up here, I thought, Uncle Benjen will ride back tonight, and I&apos;ll see him first and blow the horn.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3309</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He never came, though.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3310</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Not that night and not any night.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3311</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Give him time,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3312</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If he doesn&apos;t come back,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3313</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ghost and I will go find him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3314</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I believe you,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3315</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My lord,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3316</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Be seated,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3317</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I see you have started without me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3318</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I am pleased to know there are still some men of sense in this city.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3319</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The talk in the yard is we shall have a tourney, my lord,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3320</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They say that knights will come from all over the realm to joust and feast in honor of your appointment as Hand of the King.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3321</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do they also say this is the last thing in the world I would have wished?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3322</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A tourney,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3323</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Will we be permitted to go, Father?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3324</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You know my feelings, Sansa.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3325</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It seems I must arrange Robert&apos;s games and pretend to be honored for his sake.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3326</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That does not mean I must subject my daughters to this folly.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3327</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, please,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3328</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I want to see.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3329</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Princess Myrcella will be there, my lord, and her younger than Lady Sansa.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3330</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>All the ladies of the court will be expected at a grand event like this, and as the tourney is in your honor, it would look queer if your family did not attend.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3331</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I suppose so.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3332</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Very well, I shall arrange a place for you, Sansa.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3333</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>For both of you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>Mine.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>3376</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Give it to me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3377</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A bravo&apos;s blade,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3378</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yet it seems to me that I know this maker&apos;s mark.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3379</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This is Mikken&apos;s work.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>My nine-year-old daughter is being armed from my own forge, and I know nothing of it.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>The Hand of the King is expected to rule the Seven Kingdoms, yet it seems I cannot even rule my own household.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>3382</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How is it that you come to own a sword, Arya?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3383</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Where did you get this?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3384</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I don&apos;t suppose it matters, truly.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>This is no toy for children, least of all for a girl.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>What would Septa Mordane say if she knew you were playing with swords?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3387</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I wasn&apos;t playing,</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>3388</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I hate Septa Mordane.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>3389</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That&apos;s enough.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>The septa is doing no more than is her duty, though gods know you have made it a struggle for the poor woman.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>3391</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your mother and I have charged her with the impossible task of making you a lady.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>I don&apos;t want to be a lady!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3393</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I ought to snap this toy across my knee here and now, and put an end to this nonsense.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>3394</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Needle wouldn&apos;t break,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3395</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It has a name, does it?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3396</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ah, Arya.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3397</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You have a wildness in you, child.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>â€˜The wolf blood,â€™ my father used to call it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3399</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lyanna had a touch of it, and my brother Brandon more than a touch.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3400</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It brought them both to an early grave.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3401</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lyanna might have carried a sword, if my lord father had allowed it.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>3402</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You remind me of her sometimes.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>3403</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You even look like her.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3404</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lyanna was beautiful,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3405</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She was,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3406</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>beautiful, and willful, and dead before her time.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3407</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Arya, what did you think to do with thisâ€¦ Needle?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3408</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Who did you hope to skewer?</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Your sister?</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Septa Mordane?</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>3411</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do you know the first thing about sword fighting?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3412</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Stick them with the pointy end,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3413</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That is the essence of it, I suppose.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3414</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I was trying to learn, butâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3415</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I asked Mycah to practice with me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3416</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I asked him,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3417</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It was my fault, it was meâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3418</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No, sweet one,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3419</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Grieve for your friend, but never blame yourself.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3420</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You did not kill the butcher&apos;s boy.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3421</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That murder lies at the Hound&apos;s door, him and the cruel woman he serves.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3422</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I hate them,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3423</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Hound and the queen and the king and Prince Joffrey.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3424</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I hate all of them.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3425</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Joffrey lied, it wasn&apos;t the way he said.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3426</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I hate Sansa too.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3427</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She did remember, she just lied so Joffrey would like her.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3428</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We all lie,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3429</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Or did you truly think I&apos;d believe that Nymeria ran off?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3430</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Jory promised not to tell.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3431</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Jory kept his word,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3432</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There are some things I do not need to be told.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3433</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Even a blind man could see that wolf would never have left you willingly.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3434</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We had to throw rocks,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3435</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I told her to run, to go be free, that I didn&apos;t want her anymore.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3436</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There were other wolves for her to play with, we heard them howling, and Jory said the woods were full of game, so she&apos;d have deer to hunt.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3437</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Only she kept following, and finally we had to throw rocks.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3438</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I hit her twice.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3439</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She whined and looked at me and I felt so â€™shamed, but it was right, wasn&apos;t it?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3440</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The queen would have killed her.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3441</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It was right,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3442</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And even the lie wasâ€¦ not without honor.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3443</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Arya, sit down.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3444</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I need to try and explain some things to you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3445</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You are too young to be burdened with all my cares,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3446</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>but you are also a Stark of Winterfell.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3447</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You know our words.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3448</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Winter is coming,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3449</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The hard cruel times,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3450</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We tasted them on the Trident, child, and when Bran fell.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3451</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You were born in the long summer, sweet one, you&apos;ve never known anything else, but now the winter is truly coming.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3452</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Remember the sigil of our House, Arya.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3453</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The direwolf,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3454</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Let me tell you something about wolves, child.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3455</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>When the snows fall and the white winds blow, the lone wolf dies, but the pack survives.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3456</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Summer is the time for squabbles.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3457</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>In winter, we must protect one another, keep each other warm, share our strengths.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3458</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So if you must hate, Arya, hate those who would truly do us harm.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3459</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Septa Mordane is a good woman, and Sansaâ€¦ Sansa is your sister.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3460</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You may be as different as the sun and the moon, but the same blood flows through both your hearts.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3461</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You need her, as she needs youâ€¦ and I need both of you, gods help me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3462</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I don&apos;t hate Sansa,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3463</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Not truly.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3464</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I do not mean to frighten you, but neither will I lie to you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3465</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We have come to a dark dangerous place, child.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3466</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This is not Winterfell.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3467</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We have enemies who mean us ill.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3468</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We cannot fight a war among ourselves.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3469</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This willfulness of yours, the running off, the angry words, the disobedienceâ€¦ at home, these were only the summer games of a child.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3470</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Here and now, with winter soon upon us, that is a different matter.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3471</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It is time to begin growing up.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3472</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I will,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3473</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I can be strong too.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3474</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I can be as strong as Robb.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3475</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Here.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3476</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Go on, it&apos;s yours,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3477</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I can keep it?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3478</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>For true?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3479</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>For true.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3480</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If I took it away, no doubt I&apos;d find a morningstar hidden under your pillow within the fortnight.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3481</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Try not to stab your sister, whatever the provocation.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3482</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I won&apos;t.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3483</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I promise.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3484</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You are late, boy.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3485</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Tomorrow you will be here at midday.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3486</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Who are you?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3487</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I am your dancing master.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3488</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Tomorrow you will catch it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3489</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Now pick it up.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3490</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That is not the way, boy.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3491</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This is not a greatsword that is needing two hands to swing it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3492</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You will take the blade in one hand.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3493</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s too heavy,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3494</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It is heavy as it needs to be to make you strong, and for the balancing.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3495</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A hollow inside is filled with lead, just so.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3496</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>One hand now is all that is needing.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3497</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The left is good.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3498</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>All is reversed, it will make your enemies more awkward.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3499</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Now you are standing wrong.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3500</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Turn your body sideface, yes, so.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>He could not lead an army even if my lord husband gave him one,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>He has no coin and the only knight who follows him reviles him as less than a snake.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3632</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Once there were two moons in the sky, but one wandered too close to the sun and cracked from the heat.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3633</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A thousand thousand dragons poured forth, and drank the fire of the sun.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>3634</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That is why dragons breathe flame.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Fear is for the long night, when the sun hides its face for years at a time, and little children are born and live and die all in darkness while the direwolves grow gaunt and hungry, and the white walkers move through the woods.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3671</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You mean the Others,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3672</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Others,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3673</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Thousands and thousands of years ago, a winter fell that was cold and hard and endless beyond all memory of man.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3674</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There came a night that lasted a generation, and kings shivered and died in their castles even as the swineherds in their hovels.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3675</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Women smothered their children rather than see them starve, and cried, and felt their tears freeze on their cheeks.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3676</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So, child.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3677</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This is the sort of story you like?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3678</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3679</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>yes, onlyâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3680</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>In that darkness, the Others came for the first time,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3681</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They were cold things, dead things, that hated iron and fire and the touch of the sun, and every creature with hot blood in its veins.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3682</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They swept over holdfasts and cities and kingdoms, felled heroes and armies by the score, riding their pale dead horses and leading hosts of the slain.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3683</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>All the swords of men could not stay their advance, and even maidens and suckling babes found no pity in them.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3684</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They hunted the maids through frozen forests, and fed their dead servants on the flesh of human children.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3685</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Now these were the days before the Andals came, and long before the women fled across the narrow sea from the cities of the Rhoyne, and the hundred kingdoms of those times were the kingdoms of the First Men, who had taken these lands from the children of the forest.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3686</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yet here and there in the fastness of the woods the children still lived in their wooden cities and hollow hills, and the faces in the trees kept watch.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3687</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So as cold and death filled the earth, the last hero determined to seek out the children, in the hopes that their ancient magics could win back what the armies of men had lost.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3688</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He set out into the dead lands with a sword, a horse, a dog, and a dozen companions.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3689</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>For years he searched, until he despaired of ever finding the children of the forest in their secret cities.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3690</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>One by one his friends died, and his horse, and finally even his dog, and his sword froze so hard the blade snapped when he tried to use it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3691</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And the Others smelled the hot blood in him, and came silent on his trail, stalking him with packs of pale white spiders big as houndsâ€”</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3692</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Hodor!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3693</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We have visitors,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3694</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>and your presence is required, Bran.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3695</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m listening to a story now,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3696</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Stories wait, my little lord, and when you come back to them, why, there they are,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3697</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Visitors are not so patient, and ofttimes they bring stories of their own.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3698</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Who is it?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3699</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Tyrion Lannister, and some men of the Night&apos;s Watch, with word from your brother Jon.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3700</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Robb is meeting with them now.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3701</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Hodor, will you help Bran down to the hall?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3702</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Hodor!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3703</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Hodor,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3704</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Hodor</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3705</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Any man of the Night&apos;s Watch is welcome here at Winterfell for as long as he wishes to stay,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3706</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Any man of the Night&apos;s Watch,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3707</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>but not me, do I take your meaning, boy?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3708</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I am the lord here while my mother and father are away, Lannister.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3709</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I am not your boy.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3710</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If you are a lord, you might learn a lord&apos;s courtesy,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3711</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your bastard brother has all your father&apos;s graces, it would seem.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3712</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Jon,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3713</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So it is true, the boy lives.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3714</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I could scarce believe it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3715</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You Starks are hard to kill.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3716</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You Lannisters had best remember that,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3717</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Hodor, bring my brother here.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3718</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Hodor,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3719</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You said you had business with Bran.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3720</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well, here he is, Lannister.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3721</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I am told you were quite the climber, Bran,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3722</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Tell me, how is it you happened to fall that day?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3723</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I never,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3724</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The child does not remember anything of the fall, or the climb that came before it,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3725</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Curious,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3726</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My brother is not here to answer questions, Lannister,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3727</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do your business and be on your way.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3728</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have a gift for you,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3729</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do you like to ride, boy?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3730</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My lord, the child has lost the use of his legs.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3731</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He cannot sit a horse.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3732</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Nonsense,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3733</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>With the right horse and the right saddle, even a cripple can ride.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3734</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m not a cripple!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3735</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Then I am not a dwarf,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3736</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My father will rejoice to hear it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3737</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What sort of horse and saddle are you suggesting?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3738</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A smart horse,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3739</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The boy cannot use his legs to command the animal, so you must shape the horse to the rider, teach it to respond to the reins, to the voice.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3740</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I would begin with an unbroken yearling, with no old training to be unlearned.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3741</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Give this to your saddler.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3742</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He will provide the rest.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3743</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I see.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3744</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You draw nicely, my lord.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3745</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes, this ought to work.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3746</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I should have thought of this myself.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3747</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It came easier to me, Maester.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3748</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It is not terribly unlike my own saddles.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3749</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Will I truly be able to ride?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3750</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You will,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3751</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And I swear to you, boy, on horseback you will be as tall as any of them.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3752</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Is this some trap, Lannister?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3753</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What&apos;s Bran to you?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3754</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why should you want to help him?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3755</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your brother Jon asked it of me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3756</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And I have a tender spot in my heart for cripples and bastards and broken things.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3757</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The wolves do not like your smell, Lannister,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3758</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Perhaps it&apos;s time I took my leave,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3759</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3760</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Summer, here.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3761</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Summer, to me!</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3762</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Grey Wind.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3763</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Rickon, call him,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3764</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Home, Shaggy, home now.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3765</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How interesting.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3766</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Are you well, my lord?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3767</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My sleeve is torn and my breeches are unaccountably damp, but nothing was harmed save my dignity.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3768</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The wolvesâ€¦ I don&apos;t know why they did thatâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3769</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No doubt they mistook me for dinner.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3770</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I thank you for calling them off, young ser.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3771</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I promise you, they would have found me quite indigestible.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3772</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And now I will be leaving, truly.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3773</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A moment, my lord,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3774</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Iâ€¦ I may have been hasty with you,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3775</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;ve done Bran a kindness, and, wellâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3776</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The hospitality of Winterfell is yours if you wish it, Lannister.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3777</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Spare me your false courtesies, boy.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3778</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You do not love me and you do not want me here.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3779</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I saw an inn outside your walls, in the winter town.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3780</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ll find a bed there, and both of us will sleep easier.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3781</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>For a few coppers I may even find a comely wench to warm the sheets for me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3782</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yoren, we go south at daybreak.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3783</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You will find me on the road, no doubt.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3784</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have had rooms prepared, and you&apos;ll find no lack of hot water to wash off the dust of the road.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3785</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I hope you will honor us at table tonight.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>3786</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Hodor,</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>3787</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Summer,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3788</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I can ride now,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3789</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We can go hunting in the woods soon, wait and see.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3790</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I didn&apos;t hear,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3791</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I didn&apos;t, I didn&apos;t.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Ser Alliser&apos;s bane,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3795</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What is it?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3796</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There&apos;s hard news, m&apos;lords, and a cruel way to pay you for your meat and mead, but the man as asks the question must bear the answer.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3797</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Stark&apos;s gone.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3798</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Old Bear sent him out to look for Waymar Royce, and he&apos;s late returning, my lord.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3799</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Too long,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3800</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Most like he&apos;s dead.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>My uncle is not dead,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>My uncle is not dead!</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Whatever you say, m&apos;lord,</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3805</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There&apos;s not a man on the Wall knows the haunted forest better than Benjen Stark.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3806</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He&apos;ll find his way back.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3807</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3808</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>maybe he will and maybe he won&apos;t.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3809</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Good men have gone into those woods before, and never come out.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>3810</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The children will help him,</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>3811</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>the children of the forest!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3812</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Bran, the children of the forest have been dead and gone for thousands of years.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3813</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>All that is left of them are the faces in the trees.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3814</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Down here, might be that&apos;s true, Maester,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3815</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>but up past the Wall, who&apos;s to say?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3816</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Up there, a man can&apos;t always tell what&apos;s alive and what&apos;s dead.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3817</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We&apos;ll find a horse for you, I promise,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3818</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Are they ever coming back?</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Yes,</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>3820</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Mother will be home soon.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3821</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Maybe we can ride out to meet her when she comes.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3822</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Wouldn&apos;t that surprise her, to see you ahorse?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3823</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And afterward, we&apos;ll ride north to see the Wall.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3824</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We won&apos;t even tell Jon we&apos;re coming, we&apos;ll just be there one day, you and me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3825</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It will be an adventure.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>An adventure,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3827</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Arryn&apos;s death was a great sadness for all of us, my lord,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3828</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I would be more than happy to tell you what I can of the manner of his passing.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>Would you care for refreshments?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3831</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Some dates, perhaps?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3832</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have some very fine persimmons as well.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3833</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Wine no longer agrees with my digestion, I fear, but I can offer you a cup of iced milk, sweetened with honey.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3834</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I find it most refreshing in this heat.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3835</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That would be most kind,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3836</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Iced milk for the King&apos;s Hand and myself, if you would be so kind, child.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3837</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well sweetened.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>The smallfolk say that the last year of summer is always the hottest.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3839</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It is not so, yet ofttimes it feels that way, does it not?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3840</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>On days like this, I envy you northerners your summer snows.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3841</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>To be sure, King Maekar&apos;s summer was hotter than this one, and near as long.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3842</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There were fools, even in the Citadel, who took that to mean that the Great Summer had come at last, the summer that never ends, but in the seventh year it broke suddenly, and we had a short autumn and a terrible long winter.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3843</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Still, the heat was fierce while it lasted.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3844</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oldtown steamed and sweltered by day and came alive only by night.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3845</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We would walk in the gardens by the river and argue about the gods.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3846</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I remember the smells of those nights, my lordâ€”perfume and sweat, melons ripe to bursting, peaches and pomegranates, nightshade and moonbloom.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3847</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I was a young man then, still forging my chain.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3848</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The heat did not exhaust me as it does now.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3849</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My pardons, Lord Eddard.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3850</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You did not come to hear foolish meanderings of a summer forgotten before your father was born.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3851</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Forgive an old man his wanderings, if you would.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Minds are like swords, I do fear.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>The old ones go to rust.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Ah, and here is our milk.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3855</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Sweet child.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3856</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Thank you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3857</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You may go.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3858</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Now where were we?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3859</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, yes.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3860</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You asked about Lord Arrynâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3861</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I did.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3862</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If truth be told, the Hand had not seemed quite himself for some time,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3863</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We had sat together on council many a year, he and I, and the signs were there to read, but I put them down to the great burdens he had borne so faithfully for so long.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3864</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Those broad shoulders were weighed down by all the cares of the realm, and more besides.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3865</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>His son was ever sickly, and his lady wife so anxious that she would scarcely let the boy out of her sight.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3866</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It was enough to weary even a strong man, and the Lord Jon was not young.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3867</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Small wonder if he seemed melancholy and tired.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3868</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Or so I thought at the time.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3869</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yet now I am less certain.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3870</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What can you tell me of his final illness?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3871</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He came to me one day asking after a certain book, as hale and healthy as ever, though it did seem to me that something was troubling him deeply.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3872</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The next morning he was twisted over in pain, too sick to rise from bed.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3873</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Maester Colemon thought it was a chill on the stomach.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3874</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The weather had been hot, and the Hand often iced his wine, which can upset the digestion.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3875</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>When Lord Jon continued to weaken, I went to him myself, but the gods did not grant me the power to save him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3876</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have heard that you sent Maester Colemon away.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3877</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I did, and I fear the Lady Lysa will never forgive me that.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3878</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Maybe I was wrong, but at the time I thought it best.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3879</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Maester Colemon is like a son to me, and I yield to none in my esteem for his abilities, but he is young, and the young ofttimes do not comprehend the frailty of an older body.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3880</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He was purging Lord Arryn with wasting potions and pepper juice, and I feared he might kill him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3881</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Did Lord Arryn say anything to you during his final hours?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3882</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>In the last stage of his fever, the Hand called out the name Robert several times, but whether he was asking for his son or for the king I could not say.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3883</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lady Lysa would not permit the boy to enter the sickroom, for fear that he too might be taken ill.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3884</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The king did come, and he sat beside the bed for hours, talking and joking of times long past in hopes of raising Lord Jon&apos;s spirits.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3885</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>His love was fierce to see.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3886</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Was there nothing else?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3887</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No final words?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3888</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>When I saw that all hope had fled, I gave the Hand the milk of the poppy, so he should not suffer.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3889</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Just before he closed his eyes for the last time, he whispered something to the king and his lady wife, a blessing for his son.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3890</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The seed is strong, he said.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3891</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>At the end, his speech was too slurred to comprehend.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3892</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Death did not come until the next morning, but Lord Jon was at peace after that.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3893</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He never spoke again.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3894</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Did it seem to you that there was anything unnatural about Lord Arryn&apos;s death?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3895</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Unnatural?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3896</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No, I could not say so.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3897</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Sad, for a certainty.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3898</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yet in its own way, death is the most natural thing of all, Lord Eddard.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3899</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Jon Arryn rests easy now, his burdens lifted at last.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3900</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This illness that took him,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3901</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Had you ever seen its like before, in other men?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3902</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Near forty years I have been Grand Maester of the Seven Kingdoms,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3903</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Under our good King Robert, and Aerys Targaryen before him, and his father Jaehaerys the Second before him, and even for a few short months under Jaehaerys&apos;s father, Aegon the Fortunate, the Fifth of His Name.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3904</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have seen more of illness than I care to remember, my lord.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3905</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I will tell you this: Every case is different, and every case is alike.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3906</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Jon&apos;s death was no stranger than any other.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3907</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>His wife thought otherwise.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3908</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I recall now, the widow is sister to your own noble wife.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3909</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If an old man may be forgiven his blunt speech, let me say that grief can derange even the strongest and most disciplined of minds, and the Lady Lysa was never that.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3910</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Since her last stillbirth, she has seen enemies in every shadow, and the death of her lord husband left her shattered and lost.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3911</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So you are quite certain that Jon Arryn died of a sudden illness?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3912</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I am,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3913</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If not illness, my good lord, what else could it be?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3914</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Poison,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3915</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A disturbing thought.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3916</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We are not the Free Cities, where such things are common.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3917</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Grand Maester Aethelmure wrote that all men carry murder in their hearts, yet even so, the poisoner is beneath contempt.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3918</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What you suggest is possible, my lord, yet I do not think it likely.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3919</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Every hedge maester knows the common poisons, and Lord Arryn displayed none of the signs.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3920</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And the Hand was loved by all.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3921</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What sort of monster in man&apos;s flesh would dare to murder such a noble lord?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3922</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have heard it said that poison is a woman&apos;s weapon.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3923</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It is said.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3924</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Women, cravensâ€¦ and eunuchs.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3925</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Lord Varys was born a slave in Lys, did you know?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3926</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Put not your trust in spiders, my lord.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3927</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I will remember that, Maester.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3928</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And I thank you for your help.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3929</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have taken enough of your time.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3930</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I hope I have helped in some small way to put your mind at ease.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3931</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If there is any other service I might perform, you need only ask.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3932</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>One thing,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3933</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I should be curious to examine the book that you lent Jon the day before he fell ill.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3934</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I fear you would find it of little interest,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3935</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It was a ponderous tome by Grand Maester Malleon on the lineages of the great houses.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3936</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Still, I should like to see it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3937</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>As you wish.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3938</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have it here somewhere.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3939</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>When I find it, I shall have it sent to your chambers straightaway.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3940</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You have been most courteous,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3941</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>One last question, if you would be so kind.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3942</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You mentioned that the king was at Lord Arryn&apos;s bedside when he died.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3943</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I wonder, was the queen with him?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3944</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why, no,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3945</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She and the children were making the journey to Casterly Rock, in company with her father.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3946</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Tywin had brought a retinue to the city for the tourney on Prince Joffrey&apos;s name day, no doubt hoping to see his son Jaime win the champion&apos;s crown.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3947</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>In that he was sadly disappointed.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3948</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It fell to me to send the queen word of Lord Arryn&apos;s sudden death.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3949</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Never have I sent off a bird with a heavier heart.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3950</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Dark wings, dark words,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3951</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So the fishwives say,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3952</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>but we know it is not always so.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3953</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>When Maester Luwin&apos;s bird brought the word about your Bran, the message lifted every true heart in the castle, did it not?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3954</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>As you say, Maester.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3955</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The gods are merciful.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3956</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Come to me as often as you like, Lord Eddard.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3957</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I am here to serve.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3958</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Arya, what are you doing?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3959</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Syrio says a water dancer can stand on one toe for hours.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3960</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Which toe?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3961</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Any toe,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3962</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Must you do your standing here?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3963</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s a long hard fall down these steps.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3964</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Syrio says a water dancer never falls.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3965</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Father, will Bran come and live with us now?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3966</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Not for a long time, sweet one,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3967</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He needs to win his strength back.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3968</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What will Bran do when he&apos;s of age?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3969</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He has years to find that answer, Arya.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3970</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>For now, it is enough to know that he will live.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3971</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I dreamed of Bran,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3972</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I saw him smiling.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3973</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He was going to be a knight,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3974</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A knight of the Kingsguard.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3975</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Can he still be a knight?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3976</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3977</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yet someday he may be the lord of a great holdfast and sit on the king&apos;s council.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3978</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He might raise castles like Brandon the Builder, or sail a ship across the Sunset Sea, or enter your mother&apos;s Faith and become the High Septon.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3979</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Can I be a king&apos;s councillor and build castles and become the High Septon?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3980</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3981</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>will marry a king and rule his castle, and your sons will be knights and princes and lords and, yes, perhaps even a High Septon.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3982</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3983</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>that&apos;s Sansa.</quotetext>
	</quote>

	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3985</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Baelish is without and begs audience.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3986</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Escort him to my solar,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3987</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ll see him at once.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3988</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If only old Selmy&apos;s mind were as nimble as his blade,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3989</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>our council meetings would be a good deal livelier.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3990</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ser Barristan is as valiant and honorable as any man in King&apos;s Landing.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3991</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And as tiresome,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3992</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>though I daresay he should do well in the tourney.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3993</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Last year he unhorsed the Hound, and it was only four years ago that he was champion.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3994</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Is there a reason for this visit, Lord Petyr, or are you here simply to enjoy the view from my window?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3995</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I promised Cat I would help you in your inquiries, and so I have.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3996</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You have something for me?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3997</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Someone,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3998</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Four someones, if truth be told.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3999</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Had you thought to question the Hand&apos;s servants?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4000</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Would that I could.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>Lady Arryn took her household back to the Eyrie.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4002</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Most of her household,</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>4003</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>not all.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4004</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A few remain.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4005</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A pregnant kitchen girl hastily wed to one of Lord Renly&apos;s grooms, a stablehand who joined the City Watch, a potboy discharged from service for theft, and Lord Arryn&apos;s squire.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4006</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>His squire?</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>4008</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The king knighted the boy after Lord Arryn&apos;s death.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>4009</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I shall send for him,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4010</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And the others.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4011</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My lord, step over here to the window, if you would be so kind.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4012</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4013</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Come, and I&apos;ll show you, my lord.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4014</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There, across the yard, at the door of the armory, do you see the boy squatting by the steps honing a sword with an oilstone?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4015</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What of him?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4016</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He reports to Varys.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4017</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Spider has taken a great interest in you and all your doings.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4018</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Now glance at the wall.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4019</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Farther west, above the stables.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4020</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The guardsman leaning on the ramparts?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4021</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Another of the eunuch&apos;s whisperers?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4022</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No, this one belongs to the queen.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4023</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Notice that he enjoys a fine view of the door to this tower, the better to note who calls on you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4024</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There are others, many unknown even to me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4025</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Red Keep is full of eyes.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4026</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why do you think I hid Cat in a brothel?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4027</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Seven hells,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4028</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Is everyone someone&apos;s informer in this cursed city?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4029</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Scarcely,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4030</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why, there&apos;s me, you, the kingâ€¦ although, come to think on it, the king tells the queen much too much, and I&apos;m less than certain about you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4031</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Is there a man in your service that you trust utterly and completely?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4032</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4033</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>In that case, I have a delightful palace in Valyria that I would dearly love to sell you,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4034</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The wiser answer was no, my lord, but be that as it may.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4035</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Send this paragon of yours to Ser Hugh and the others.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4036</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your own comings and goings will be noted, but even Varys the Spider cannot watch every man in your service every hour of the day.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4037</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Petyr,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4038</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Iâ€¦ am grateful for your help.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4039</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Perhaps I was wrong to distrust you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4040</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You are slow to learn, Lord Eddard.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4041</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Distrusting me was the wisest thing you&apos;ve done since you climbed down off your horse.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4042</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your feet should be farther apart,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4043</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You don&apos;t want to lose your balance.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4044</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That&apos;s good.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4045</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Now pivot as you deliver the stroke, get all your weight behind the blade.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4046</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Seven gods,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4047</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Would you look at this, Jon.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4048</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Theyâ€¦ they told me I was to come here forâ€¦ for training,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4049</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A lordling,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4050</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Southron, most like near Highgarden.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4051</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It would seem they have run short of poachers and thieves down south.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4052</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Now they send us pigs to man the Wall.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4053</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Is fur and velvet your notion of armor, my Lord of Ham?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4054</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Let us hope you are not as inept as you look,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4055</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Halder, see what Ser Piggy can do.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4056</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This will be uglier than a whore&apos;s ass,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4057</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I yield,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4058</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No more, I yield, don&apos;t hit me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4059</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>On your feet, Ser Piggy,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4060</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Pick up your sword.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4061</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Hit him with the flat of your blade until he finds his feet.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4062</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You can hit harder than that,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4063</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Jon, no,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4064</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>On your feet,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4065</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ser Piggy is starting to grasp the notion,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4066</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Again.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4067</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Cut us off a ham!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4068</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Halder, enough.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4069</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Bastard speaks and the peasants tremble,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4070</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I remind you that I am the master-at-arms here, Lord Snow.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4071</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Look at him, Halder,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4072</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There&apos;s no honor in beating a fallen foe.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4073</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He yielded.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4074</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He yielded,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4075</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It would seem our Bastard is in love,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4076</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Show me your steel, Lord Snow.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4077</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Bastard wishes to defend his lady love, so we shall make an exercise of it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4078</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Rat, Pimple, help our Stone Head here.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4079</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Three of you ought to be sufficient to make Lady Piggy squeal.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4080</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>All you need do is get past the Bastard.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4081</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Stay behind me,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4082</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Three to two will make for better sport,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4083</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why are you waiting?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4084</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I yield,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4085</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The mummer&apos;s farce has gone on long enough for today.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4086</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>For an instant, I thought I finally had you, Snow.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4087</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>For an instant, you did,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4088</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Let me,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4089</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Did he hurt you?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4090</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ve been bruised before.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>My name is Samwell Tarly, of Hornâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4092</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I mean, I was of Horn Hill, until Iâ€¦ left.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4093</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ve come to take the black.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4094</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My father is Lord Randyll, a bannerman to the Tyrells of Highgarden.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4095</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I used to be his heir, onlyâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4096</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m Jon Snow, Ned Stark&apos;s bastard, of Winterfell.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Iâ€¦ if you want, you can call me Sam.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>My mother calls me Sam.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4099</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You can call him Lord Snow,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4100</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You don&apos;t want to know what his mother calls him.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>These two are Grenn and Pypar,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Grenn&apos;s the ugly one,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>You&apos;re uglier than me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>At least I don&apos;t have ears like a bat.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>4105</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My thanks to all of you,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>Why didn&apos;t you get up and fight?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4107</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I wanted to, truly.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>I didn&apos;t want him to hit me anymore.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Iâ€¦ I fear I&apos;m a coward.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>My lord father always said so.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>What if they think we&apos;re craven too?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4121</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;re too stupid to be craven,</quotetext>

	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4125</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I would not,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4126</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;d run away faster than you.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Is that a wolf?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4128</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A direwolf,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>His name is Ghost.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>We were crossing the barrowlands, me and the men my father sent to see me north, and this white stuff began to fall, like a soft rain.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4151</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>At first I thought it was so beautiful, like feathers drifting from the sky, but it kept on and on, until I was frozen to the bone.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4152</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The men had crusts of snow in their beards and more on their shoulders, and still it kept coming.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4153</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I was afraid it would never end.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4154</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Are they going to make me go up there?</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>There&apos;s a winch,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4157</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They can draw you up in a cage.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>I don&apos;t like high places.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Are you afraid of everything?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4160</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I don&apos;t understand.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>If you are truly so craven, why are you here?</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>Sometimes I dream about it,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4164</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m walking down this long empty hall.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4165</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My voice echoes all around, but no one answers, so I walk faster, opening doors, shouting names.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4166</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I don&apos;t even know who I&apos;m looking for.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4167</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Most nights it&apos;s my father, but sometimes it&apos;s Robb instead, or my little sister Arya, or my uncle.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4168</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do you ever find anyone in your dream?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4169</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No one.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4170</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The castle is always empty.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4171</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Even the ravens are gone from the rookery, and the stables are full of bones.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4172</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That always scares me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4173</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I start to run then, throwing open doors, climbing the tower three steps at a time, screaming for someone, for anyone.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4174</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And then I find myself in front of the door to the crypts.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4175</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s black inside, and I can see the steps spiraling down.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4176</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Somehow I know I have to go down there, but I don&apos;t want to.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4177</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m afraid of what might be waiting for me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4178</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The old Kings of Winter are down there, sitting on their thrones with stone wolves at their feet and iron swords across their laps, but it&apos;s not them I&apos;m afraid of.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4179</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I scream that I&apos;m not a Stark, that this isn&apos;t my place, but it&apos;s no good, I have to go anyway, so I start down, feeling the walls as I descend, with no torch to light the way.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4180</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It gets darker and darker, until I want to scream.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>4185</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>One time,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4186</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>two men came to the castle, warlocks from Qarth with white skin and blue lips.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4187</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They slaughtered a bull aurochs and made me bathe in the hot blood, but it didn&apos;t make me brave as they&apos;d promised.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4188</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I got sick and retched.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Father had them scourged.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>You are almost a man grown now, and my heir,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4191</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If you do not, then on the morrow we shall have a hunt, and somewhere in these woods your horse will stumble, and you will be thrown from the saddle to dieâ€¦ or so I will tell your mother.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4192</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She has a woman&apos;s heart and finds it in her to cherish even you, and I have no wish to cause her pain.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4193</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Please do not imagine that it will truly be that easy, should you think to defy me.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>or this.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4199</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We should go back to the common hall.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4200</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4201</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There&apos;s hot cider to drink, or mulled wine if you prefer.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Some nights Dareon sings for us, if the mood is on him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4203</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He was a singer, beforeâ€¦ well, not truly, but almost, an apprentice singer.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4204</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How did he come here?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4205</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Rowan of Goldengrove found him in bed with his daughter.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4206</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The girl was two years older, and Dareon swears she helped him through her window, but under her father&apos;s eye she named it rape, so here he is.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4207</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>When Maester Aemon heard him sing, he said his voice was honey poured over thunder.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>Toad sometimes sings too, if you call it singing.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4209</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Drinking songs he learned in his father&apos;s winesink.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4210</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Pyp says his voice is piss poured over a fart.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4211</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I should like to hear them both,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4212</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>but they would not want me there.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4213</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He&apos;s going to make me fight again on the morrow, isn&apos;t he?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4214</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He is,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4215</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I had better try to sleep.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>Where have you been?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4217</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Talking with Sam,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4218</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He truly is craven,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4219</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>At supper, there were still places on the bench when he got his pie, but he was too scared to come sit with us.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4220</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Lord of Ham thinks he&apos;s too good to eat with the likes of us,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4221</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I saw him eat a pork pie,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4222</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do you think it was a brother?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4223</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Stop it!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4224</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Listen to me,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4225</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You girls do as you please,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4226</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>but if Thorne sends me against Lady Piggy, I&apos;m going to slice me off a rasher of bacon.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4227</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Remember, we know where you sleep,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4228</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I don&apos;t know what you did,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4229</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>but I know you did it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4230</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ve never had a friend before.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>My uncle spoke truly,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4234</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s the hand&apos;s tourney that&apos;s the cause of all the trouble, my lords,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4235</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The king&apos;s tourney,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4236</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I assure you, the Hand wants no part of it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4237</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Call it what you will, my lord.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4238</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Knights have been arriving from all over the realm, and for every knight we get two freeriders, three craftsmen, six men-at-arms, a dozen merchants, two dozen whores, and more thieves than I dare guess.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4239</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This cursed heat had half the city in a fever to start, and now with all these visitorsâ€¦ last night we had a drowning, a tavern riot, three knife fights, a rape, two fires, robberies beyond count, and a drunken horse race down the Street of the Sisters.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4240</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The night before a woman&apos;s head was found in the Great Sept, floating in the rainbow pool.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4241</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No one seems to know how it got there or who it belongs to.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4242</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How dreadful,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4243</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If you cannot keep the king&apos;s peace, Janos, perhaps the City Watch should be commanded by someone who can.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4244</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Aegon the Dragon himself could not keep the peace, Lord Renly.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4245</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I need more men.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4246</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How many?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4247</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>As many as can be gotten, Lord Hand.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4248</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Hire fifty new men,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4249</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Baelish will see that you get the coin.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4250</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I will?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4251</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You will.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4252</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You found forty thousand golden dragons for a champion&apos;s purse, surely you can scrape together a few coppers to keep the king&apos;s peace.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4253</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I will also give you twenty good swords from my own household guard, to serve with the Watch until the crowds have left.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4254</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>All thanks, Lord Hand,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4255</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I promise you, they shall be put to good use.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4256</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The sooner this folly is done with, the better I shall like it.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>4257</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>the Hand&apos;s tourney,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4258</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The realm prospers from such events, my lord,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4259</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They bring the great the chance of glory, and the lowly a respite from their woes.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4260</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And put coins in many a pocket,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4261</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Every inn in the city is full, and the whores are walking bowlegged and jingling with each step.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4262</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We&apos;re fortunate my brother Stannis is not with us.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4263</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Remember the time he proposed to outlaw brothels?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4264</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The king asked him if perhaps he&apos;d like to outlaw eating, shitting, and breathing while he was at it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4265</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If truth be told, I ofttimes wonder how Stannis ever got that ugly daughter of his.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4266</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He goes to his marriage bed like a man marching to a battlefield, with a grim look in his eyes and a determination to do his duty.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4267</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I wonder about your brother Stannis as well.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4268</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I wonder when he intends to end his visit to Dragonstone and resume his seat on this council.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4269</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No doubt as soon as we&apos;ve scourged all those whores into the sea,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4270</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have heard quite enough about whores for one day,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4271</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Until the morrow.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4272</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Summon Jory to my chambers and tell your father to saddle my horse,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4273</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>As you say, my lord.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>Hand&apos;s tourney</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4275</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ve promised the City Watch twenty of my guard until the tourney is done,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4276</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I rely on you to make the choice.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4277</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Give Alyn the command, and make certain the men understand that they are needed to stop fights, not start them.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4278</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Did you find the stableboy?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4279</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The watchman, my lord,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4280</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He vows he&apos;ll never touch another horse.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4281</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What did he have to say?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4282</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He claims he knew Lord Arryn well.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4283</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Fast friends, they were.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4284</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Hand always gave the lads a copper on their name days, he says.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4285</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Had a way with horses.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4286</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Never rode his mounts too hard, and brought them carrots and apples, so they were always pleased to see him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4287</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Carrots and apples,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4288</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Did our watchman recall anything else of note?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4289</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The lad swears Lord Jon was as strong as a man half his age.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4290</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Often went riding with Lord Stannis, he says.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4291</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Where did they go on these rides?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4292</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The boy says that they visited a brothel.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4293</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A brothel?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4294</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Lord of the Eyrie and Hand of the King visited a brothel with Stannis Baratheon?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4295</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The boy insists it&apos;s true.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4296</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Hand took three guardsmen with him, and the boy says they were joking of it when he took their horses afterward.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4297</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Which brothel?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4298</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The boy did not know.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4299</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The guards would.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4300</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A pity Lysa carried them off to the Vale,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4301</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The gods are doing their best to vex us.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4302</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lady Lysa, Maester Colemon, Lord Stannisâ€¦ everyone who might actually know the truth of what happened to Jon Arryn is a thousand leagues away.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4303</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Will you summon Lord Stannis back from Dragonstone?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4304</quoteindex>

		<quotetext>Bring me my doublet, if you would.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>The grey, with the direwolf sigil.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>I want this armorer to know who I am.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Lord Renly is brother to Lord Stannis as well as the king.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Yet it seems that he was not invited on these rides.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>4312</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No,</quotetext>

	<quote>

		<quotetext>Perhaps Lord Stannis will return for Robert&apos;s tourney,</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>4314</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That would be a stroke of fortune, my lord,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>In other words, not bloody likely.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>The direwolf is the sigil of House Stark, is it not?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4339</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I could fashion a direwolf helm so real that children will run from you in the street,</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>4340</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Did you make a falcon helm for Lord Arryn?</quotetext>

		<quotetext>I regret to say, they did not honor me with their patronage.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>They asked to see the boy,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4344</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>so I took them back to the forge.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>As you wish, my lord,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>This is Lord Stark, the new Hand of the King,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>This is Gendry.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Show the Hand that helmet you made, lad.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>4352</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This is fine work.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4353</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I would be pleased if you would let me buy it.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>4354</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s not for sale.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Boy, this is the King&apos;s Hand.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4356</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If his lordship wants this helm, make him a gift of it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4357</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He honors you by asking.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4358</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I made it for me,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4359</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A hundred pardons, my lord,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4360</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The boy is crude as new steel, and like new steel would profit from some beating.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4361</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That helm is journeyman&apos;s work at best.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4362</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Forgive him and I promise I will craft you a helm like none you have ever seen.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4363</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He&apos;s done nothing that requires my forgiveness.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Gendry, when Lord Arryn came to see you, what did you talk about?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4365</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He asked me questions is all, m&apos;lord.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4366</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What sort of questions?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4367</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How was I, and was I well treated, and if I liked the work, and stuff about my mother.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4368</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Who she was and what she looked like and all.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4369</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What did you tell him?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4370</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She died when I was little.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4371</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She had yellow hair, and sometimes she used to sing to me, I remember.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4372</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She worked in an alehouse.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4373</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Did Lord Stannis question you as well?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4374</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The bald one?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4375</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No, not him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4376</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He never said no word, just glared at me, like I was some raper who done for his daughter.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4377</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Mind your filthy tongue,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4378</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This is the King&apos;s own Hand.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4379</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A smart boy, but stubborn.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4380</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That helmâ€¦ the others call him bullheaded, so he threw it in their teeth.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4381</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Look at me, Gendry.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4382</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Go back to your work, lad.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4383</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m sorry to have bothered you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4384</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Who paid the boy&apos;s apprentice fee?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4385</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You saw the boy.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4386</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Such a strong boy.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4387</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Those hands of his, those hands were made for hammers.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4388</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He had such promise, I took him on without a fee.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4389</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The truth now,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4390</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The streets are full of strong boys.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4391</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The day you take on an apprentice without a fee will be the day the Wall comes down.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4392</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Who paid for him?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4393</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A lord,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4394</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He gave no name, and wore no sigil on his coat.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4395</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He paid in gold, twice the customary sum, and said he was paying once for the boy, and once for my silence.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4396</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Describe him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4397</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He was stout, round of shoulder, not so tall as you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4398</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Brown beard, but there was a bit of red in it, I&apos;ll swear.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4399</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He wore a rich cloak, that I do remember, heavy purple velvet worked with silver threads, but the hood shadowed his face and I never did see him clear.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4400</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My lord, I want no trouble.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4401</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>None of us wants trouble, but I fear these are troubled times, Master Mott,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4402</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You know who the boy is.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4403</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I am only an armorer, my lord.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4404</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I know what I&apos;m told.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4405</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You know who the boy is,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4406</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That is not a question.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4407</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The boy is my apprentice,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4408</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Who he was before he came to me, that&apos;s none of my concern.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4409</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If the day ever comes when Gendry would rather wield a sword than forge one, send him to me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4410</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He has the look of a warrior.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4411</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Until then, you have my thanks, Master Mott, and my promise.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4412</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Should I ever want a helm to frighten children, this will be the first place I visit.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4413</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Did you find anything, my lord?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4414</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I did,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4415</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My lady, you ought cover your head,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4416</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You will take a chill.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>It is only water, Ser Rodrik,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4418</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I am soaked through,</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>4419</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Even my bones are wet.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4420</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We will want a fire tonight, my lady, and a hot meal would serve us both.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4421</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There is an inn at the crossroads up ahead,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4422</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>An inn,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4423</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If onlyâ€¦ but we dare not risk it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4424</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If we wish to remain unknown, I think it best we seek out some small holdfastâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4425</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Riders,</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>4427</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My lady, best pull up your hood.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4428</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He did not know you,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4429</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He saw a pair of mud-spattered travelers by the side of the road, wet and tired.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4430</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It would never occur to him to suspect that one of them was the daughter of his liege lord.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4431</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I think we shall be safe enough at the inn, Ser Rodrik.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4432</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Two rooms at the top of the stair, that&apos;s all there is,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4433</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They&apos;re under the bell tower, you won&apos;t be missing meals, though there&apos;s some thinks it too noisy.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4434</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Can&apos;t be helped.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>We&apos;re full up, or near as makes no matter.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>4436</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s those rooms or the road.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4437</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Leave your boots down here,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4438</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The boy will clean them.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>I won&apos;t have you tracking mud up my stairs.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Mind the bell.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>We had best make haste if we hope to eat tonight, my lady.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>That is your loss,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4467</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Who was the finest singer you&apos;ve ever heard?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4468</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Alia of Braavos,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4469</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, I&apos;m much better than that old stick,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4470</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If you have the silver for a song, I&apos;ll gladly show you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4471</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I might have a copper or two, but I&apos;d sooner toss it down a well than pay for your howling,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4472</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your grandfather has a sour nature,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4473</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I meant to do you honor.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4474</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>An homage to your beauty.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4475</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>In truth, I was made to sing for kings and high lords.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4476</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, I can see that,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4477</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Tully is fond of song, I hear.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4478</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No doubt you&apos;ve been to Riverrun.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4479</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A hundred times,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4480</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They keep a chamber for me, and the young lord is like a brother.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4481</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And Winterfell?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4482</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Have you traveled north?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4483</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s all blizzards and bearskins up there, and the Starks know no music but the howling of wolves.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4484</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Innkeep,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4485</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>we have horses that want stabling, and my lord of Lannister requires a room and a hot bath.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4486</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, gods,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4487</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m sorry, m&apos;lord, truly, we&apos;re full up, every room.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4488</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My men will steep in your stable, and as for myself, well, I do not require a large room, as you can plainly see.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4489</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So long as the fire&apos;s warm and the straw reasonably free of fleas, I am a happy man.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4490</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>M&apos;lord, there&apos;s nothing, it&apos;s the tourney, there&apos;s no help for it, ohâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4491</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;re welcome to my room, m&apos;lord.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4492</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Now there&apos;s a clever man,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4493</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And a nimble one to boot.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4494</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You will be able to manage food, I trust?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4495</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Anything you like, m&apos;lord, anything at all,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4496</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My men will have whatever you&apos;re serving these people.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4497</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Double portions, we&apos;ve had a long hard ride.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4498</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ll take a roast fowlâ€”chicken, duck, pigeon, it makes no matter.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4499</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And send up a flagon of your best wine.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4500</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yoren, will you sup with me?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4501</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Aye, m&apos;lord, I will,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4502</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My lord of Lannister!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4503</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I would be pleased to entertain you while you eat.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4504</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Let me sing you the lay of your father&apos;s great victory at King&apos;s Landing!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4505</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Nothing would be more likely to ruin my supper,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4506</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lady Stark, what an unexpected pleasure,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4507</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I was sorry to miss you at Winterfell.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4508</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ladyâ€¦ Stark?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4509</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I was still Catelyn Tully the last time I bedded here,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4510</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You in the corner,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4511</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Is that the black bat of Harrenhal I see embroidered on your surcoat, ser?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4512</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It is, my lady.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4513</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And is Lady Whent a true and honest friend to my father, Lord Hoster Tully of Riverrun?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4514</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She is,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4515</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The red stallion was ever a welcome sight in Riverrun,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4516</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My father counts Jonos Bracken among his oldest and most loyal bannermen.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4517</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Our lord is honored by his trust,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4518</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I envy your father all these fine friends,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4519</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>but I do not quite see the purpose of this, Lady Stark.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4520</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I know your sigil as well: the twin towers of Frey.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4521</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How fares your good lord, sers?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4522</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Walder is well, my lady.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4523</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He plans to take a new wife on his ninetieth name day, and has asked your lord father to honor the wedding with his presence.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4524</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This man came a guest into my house, and there conspired to murder my son, a boy of seven,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4525</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>In the name of King Robert and the good lords you serve, I call upon you to seize him and help me return him to Winterfell to await the king&apos;s justice.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4526</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It is better than the songs,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4527</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>His armor is bronze, thousands and thousands of years old, engraved with magic runes that ward him against harm,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4528</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Jory looks a beggar among these others,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4529</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Sweet lady,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4530</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>no victory is half so beautiful as you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4531</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You must be one of her daughters,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4532</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You have the Tully look.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4533</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m Sansa Stark,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4534</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have not had the honor, my lord.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4535</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Sweet child, this is Lord Petyr Baelish, of the king&apos;s small council.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4536</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your mother was my queen of beauty once,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4537</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You have her hair.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4538</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ser Loras has a keen eye for beauty, sweet lady.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4539</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He was too kind,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4540</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ser Loras is a true knight.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4541</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do you think he will win tomorrow, my lord?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4542</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4543</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My dog will do for him, or perhaps my uncle Jaime.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4544</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And in a few years, when I am old enough to enter the lists, I shall do for them all.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4545</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4546</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You do not tell me what to do, woman,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4547</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I am king here, do you understand?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4548</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I rule here, and if I say that I will fight tomorrow, I will fight!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4549</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The great knight.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4550</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I can still knock you in the dirt.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4551</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Remember that, Kingslayer.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4552</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Give me my hammer and not a man in the realm can stand before me!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4553</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>As you say, Your Grace.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4554</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;ve spilled your wine, Robert.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4555</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Let me bring you a fresh goblet.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4556</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It grows late,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4557</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do you need an escort back to the castle?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4558</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4559</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I mean to sayâ€¦ yes, thank you, that would be most kind.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4560</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I am tired, and the way is so dark.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4561</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I should be glad for some protection.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4562</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Dog!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4563</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes, Your Grace?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4564</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Take my betrothed back to the castle, and see that no harm befalls her,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4565</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Did you think Joff was going to take you himself?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4566</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Small chance of that.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4567</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Come, you&apos;re not the only one needs sleep.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4568</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ve drunk too much, and I may need to kill my brother tomorrow.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4569</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You rode gallantly today, Ser Sandor,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4570</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Spare me your empty little compliments, girlâ€¦ and your ser&apos;s.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4571</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I am no knight.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4572</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I spit on them and their vows.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4573</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My brother is a knight.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4574</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Did you see him ride today?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4575</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4576</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Gallant?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4577</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No one could withstand him,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4578</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Some septa trained you well.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4579</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;re like one of those birds from the Summer Isles, aren&apos;t you?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4580</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A pretty little talking bird, repeating all the pretty little words they taught you to recite.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4581</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That&apos;s unkind.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4582</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;re frightening me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4583</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I want to go now.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4584</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No one could withstand him,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4585</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That&apos;s truth enough.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4586</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No one could ever withstand Gregor.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4587</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That boy today, his second joust, oh, that was a pretty bit of business.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4588</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You saw that, did you?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4589</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Fool boy, he had no business riding in this company.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4590</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No money, no squire, no one to help him with that armor.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4591</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That gorget wasn&apos;t fastened proper.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4592</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You think Gregor didn&apos;t notice that?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4593</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You think Ser Gregor&apos;s lance rode up by chance, do you?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4594</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Pretty little talking girl, you believe that, you&apos;re empty-headed as a bird for true.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4595</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Gregor&apos;s lance goes where Gregor wants it to go.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4596</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Look at me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4597</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Look at me!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4598</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There&apos;s a pretty for you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4599</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Take a good long stare.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4600</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You know you want to.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4601</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ve watched you turning away all the way down the kingsroad.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4602</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Piss on that.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4603</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Take your look.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4604</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No pretty words for that, girl?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4605</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No little compliment the septa taught you?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4606</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Most of them, they think it was some battle.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4607</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A siege, a burning tower, an enemy with a torch.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4608</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>One fool asked if it was dragonsbreath.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4609</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ll tell you what it was, girl,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4610</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My father told everyone my bedding had caught fire, and our maester gave me ointments.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4611</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ointments!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4612</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Gregor got his ointments too.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4613</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Four years later, they anointed him with the seven oils and he recited his knightly vows and Rhaegar Targaryen tapped him on the shoulder and said, â€˜Arise, Ser Gregor.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4614</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He was no true knight,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4615</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4616</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>no, little bird, he was no true knight.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4617</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Thank you, my lord,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4618</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The things I told you tonight,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4619</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If you ever tell Joffreyâ€¦ your sister, your fatherâ€¦ any of themâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4620</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I won&apos;t,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4621</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I promise.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4622</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If you ever tell anyone,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4623</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ll kill you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4624</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I stood last vigil for him myself,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4625</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He had no one else.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4626</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A mother in the Vale, I am told.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4627</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Hugh was Jon Arryn&apos;s squire for four years,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>You had the better claim, Your Grace.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>4727</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I told you to drink, not to argue.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>You made me king, you could at least have the courtesy to listen when I talk, damn you.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>4729</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Look at me, Ned.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4731</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Gods, too fat for my armor, how did it ever come to this?</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Robertâ€¦</quotetext>

	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4734</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I swear to you, I was never so alive as when I was winning this throne, or so dead as now that I&apos;ve won it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4735</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And Cerseiâ€¦ I have Jon Arryn to thank for her.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4736</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I had no wish to marry after Lyanna was taken from me, but Jon said the realm needed an heir.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4737</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Cersei Lannister would be a good match, he told me, she would bind Lord Tywin to me should Viserys Targaryen ever try to win back his father&apos;s throne.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4738</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I loved that old man, I swear it, but now I think he was a bigger fool than Moon Boy.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4739</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, Cersei is lovely to look at, truly, but coldâ€¦ the way she guards her cunt, you&apos;d think she had all the gold of Casterly Rock between her legs.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4740</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Here, give me that beer if you won&apos;t drink it.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>About the wolf, I mean.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4744</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My son was lying, I&apos;d stake my soul on it.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>4748</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>More than once, I have dreamed of giving up the crown.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4749</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Take ship for the Free Cities with my horse and my hammer, spend my time warring and whoring, that&apos;s what I was made for.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>4750</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The sellsword king, how the singers would love me.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>You know what stops me?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4752</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The thought of Joffrey on the throne, with Cersei standing behind him whispering in his ear.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4753</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My son.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4754</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How could I have made a son like that, Ned?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4755</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He&apos;s only a boy,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4756</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Have you forgotten how wild you were at his age?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4757</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It would not trouble me if the boy was wild, Ned.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4758</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You don&apos;t know him as I do.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>4759</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ah, perhaps you are right.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4760</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Jon despaired of me often enough, yet I grew into a good king.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4761</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You might speak up and agree now, you know.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4762</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your Graceâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4763</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ah, say that I&apos;m a better king than Aerys and be done with it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4764</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You never could lie for love nor honor, Ned Stark.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4765</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m still young, and now that you&apos;re here with me, things will be different.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4766</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We&apos;ll make this a reign to sing of, and damn the Lannisters to seven hells.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>4767</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I smell bacon.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>The Knight of Flowers, they call him.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4772</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Last tourney, he dumped the Kingslayer on his golden rump, you ought to have seen the look on Cersei&apos;s face.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>4773</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I laughed till my sides hurt.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4775</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>â€¦had given Jon a barrel of oranges, remember?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4776</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Only the things had gone rotten, so I flung mine across the table and hit Dacks right in the nose.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4777</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You remember, Redfort&apos;s pock-faced squire?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4778</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He tossed one back at me, and before Jon could so much as fart, there were oranges flying across the High Hall in every direction.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>4779</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A hundred golden dragons on the Kingslayer,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>I wonder if I might trouble you for a drink?</quotetext>

		<quotetext>That was my dearest hope,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>It would not do if certain people learned that we had spoken in private.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>There are things you must know.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4849</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You are the King&apos;s Hand, and the king is a fool.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4850</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your friend, I know, yet a fool nonethelessâ€¦ and doomed, unless you save him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4851</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Today was a near thing.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4852</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They had hoped to kill him during the melee.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4853</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Who?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4854</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If I truly need to tell you that, you are a bigger fool than Robert and I am on the wrong side.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4855</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Lannisters,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4856</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The queenâ€¦ no, I will not believe that, not even of Cersei.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4857</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She asked him not to fight!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4858</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She forbade him to fight, in front of his brother, his knights, and half the court.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4859</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Tell me truly, do you know any surer way to force King Robert into the melee?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4860</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I ask you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4861</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Even if he&apos;d fought, who would have dared to strike the king?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4862</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There were forty riders in the melee.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4863</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Lannisters have many friends.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4864</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Amidst all that chaos, with horses screaming and bones breaking and Thoros of Myr waving that absurd firesword of his, who could name it murder if some chance blow felled His Grace?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4865</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>After the deed was done, the slayer would be beside himself with grief.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4866</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I can almost hear him weeping.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4867</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So sad.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4868</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yet no doubt the gracious and compassionate widow would take pity, lift the poor unfortunate to his feet, and bless him with a gentle kiss of forgiveness.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4869</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Good King Joffrey would have no choice but to pardon him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4870</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Or perhaps Cersei would let Ser Ilyn strike off his head.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4871</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Less risk for the Lannisters that way, though quite an unpleasant surprise for their little friend.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4872</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You knew of this plot, and yet you did nothing.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4873</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I command whisperers, not warriors.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4874</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You might have come to me earlier.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4875</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, yes, I confess it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4876</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And you would have rushed straight to the king, yes?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4877</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And when Robert heard of his peril, what would he have done?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4878</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I wonder.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4879</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He would have damned them all, and fought anyway, to show he did not fear them.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4880</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I will make another confession, Lord Eddard.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4881</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I was curious to see what you would do.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4882</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why not come to me?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4883</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>you ask, and I must answer, Why, because I did not trust you, my lord.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4884</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You did not trust me?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4885</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Red Keep shelters two sorts of people, Lord Eddard,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4886</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Those who are loyal to the realm, and those who are loyal only to themselves.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4887</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Until this morning, I could not say which you might beâ€¦ so I waited to seeâ€¦ and now I know, for a certainty.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4888</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I begin to comprehend why the queen fears you so much.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4889</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, yes I do.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4890</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You are the one she ought to fear,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4891</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4892</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I am what I am.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4893</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The king makes use of me, but it shames him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4894</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A most puissant warrior is our Robert, and such a manly man has little love for sneaks and spies and eunuchs.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4895</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If a day should come when Cersei whispers, â€˜Kill that man,â€™ Ilyn Payne will snick my head off in a twinkling, and who will mourn poor Varys then?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4896</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>North or south, they sing no songs for spiders.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4897</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But you, Lord Starkâ€¦ I thinkâ€¦ no, I knowâ€¦ he would not kill you, not even for his queen, and there may lie our salvation.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4898</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Surely Robert has other loyal friends,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4899</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>His brothers, hisâ€”</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4900</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>â€”wife?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4901</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>His brothers hate the Lannisters, true enough, but hating the queen and loving the king are not quite the same thing, are they?</quotetext>

		<quotetext>No, my lord, when the swords come out in earnest, you will be the only true friend Robert Baratheon will have.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4911</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Robert must be told,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4912</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If what you say is true, if even a part of it is true, the king must hear it for himself.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>And what proof shall we lay before him?</quotetext>

		<quotetext>My words against theirs?</quotetext>

	<quote>

		<quotetext>My little birds against the queen and the Kingslayer, against his brothers and his council, against the Wardens of East and West, against all the might of Casterly Rock?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4916</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Pray, send for Ser Ilyn directly, it will save us all some time.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>4917</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I know where that road ends.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>4919</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Indeed they will,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>and sooner rather than later, I do fear.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>You are making them most anxious, Lord Eddard.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>4929</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I wondered when you would get around to that.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4930</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Tell me.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>4931</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The tears of Lys, they call it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4932</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A rare and costly thing, clear and sweet as water, and it leaves no trace.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4933</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I begged Lord Arryn to use a taster, in this very room I begged him, but he would not hear of it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4934</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Only one who was less than a man would even think of such a thing, he told me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4935</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Who gave him the poison?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4936</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Some dear sweet friend who often shared meat and mead with him, no doubt.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4937</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, but which one?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4938</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There were many such.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4939</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Arryn was a kindly, trusting man.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4940</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There was one boy.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4941</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>All he was, he owed Jon Arryn, but when the widow fled to the Eyrie with her household, he stayed in King&apos;s Landing and prospered.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>It always gladdens my heart to see the young rise in the world.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>He must have cut a gallant figure in the tourney, him in his bright new armor, with those crescent moons on his cloak.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>We are taking him back to Winterfell,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>He&apos;ll pay a handsome reward to any man who brings him word of what happened here today.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>His men come with him,</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>4990</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And we&apos;ll thank the rest of you to stay quiet about what you&apos;ve seen here.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4991</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We must ride at once.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>4992</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We&apos;ll want fresh mounts, and provisions for the road.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>You men, know that you have the eternal gratitude of House Stark.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>splendid adventure</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>4997</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This is the high road,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4998</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The eastern road.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4999</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You said we were riding for Winterfell!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5000</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Often and loudly,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5001</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No doubt your friends will ride that way when they come after us.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5002</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I wish them good speed.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5003</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We must have some rest, my lady,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5004</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ser Willis speaks truly, my lady,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5005</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This is the third horse we have lostâ€”</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5006</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We will lose more than horses if we&apos;re overtaken by the Lannisters,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5007</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Small chance of that here,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5008</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The lady did not ask your views, dwarf,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5009</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Let him speak,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5010</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>By now our pursuit is likely racing across the Neck, chasing your lie up the kingsroadâ€¦ assuming there is a pursuit, which is by no means certain.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5011</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, no doubt the word has reached my fatherâ€¦ but my father does not love me overmuch, and I am not at all sure that he will bother to bestir himself.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5012</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This is a cruel land, Lady Stark.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5013</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;ll find no succor until you reach the Vale, and each mount you lose burdens the others all the more.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5014</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Worse, you risk losing me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5015</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I am small, and not strong, and if I die, then what&apos;s the point?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5016</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It might be said that your death is the point, Lannister,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5017</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I think not,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5018</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If you wanted me dead, you had only to say the word, and one of these staunch friends of yours would gladly have given me a red smile.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5019</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Starks do not murder men in their beds.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5020</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Nor do I,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5021</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I tell you again, I had no part in the attempt to kill your son.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5022</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The assassin was armed with your dagger.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5023</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It was not my dagger,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5024</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How many times must I swear to that?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5025</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lady Stark, whatever you may believe of me, I am not a stupid man.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5026</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Only a fool would arm a common footpad with his own blade.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5027</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why would Petyr lie to me?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5028</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why does a bear shit in the woods?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5029</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Because it is his nature.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5030</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lying comes as easily as breathing to a man like Littlefinger.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5031</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You ought to know that, you of all people.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5032</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And what does that mean, Lannister?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5033</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why, every man at court has heard him tell how he took your maidenhead, my lady.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5034</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That is a lie!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5035</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, wicked little imp,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5036</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>At your word, m&apos;lady, I&apos;ll toss his lying tongue at your feet.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5037</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Petyr Baelish loved me once.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5038</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He was only a boy.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5039</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>His passion was a tragedy for all of us, but it was real, and pure, and nothing to be made mock of.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5040</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He wanted my hand.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5041</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That is the truth of the matter.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5042</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You are truly an evil man, Lannister.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5043</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And you are truly a fool, Lady Stark.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5044</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Littlefinger has never loved anyone but Littlefinger, and I promise you that it is not your hand that he boasts of, it&apos;s those ripe breasts of yours, and that sweet mouth, and the heat between your legs.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5045</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Shall I bleed him, my lady?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5046</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Kill me and the truth dies with me,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5047</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Let him talk,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5048</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How did Littlefinger tell you I came by this dagger of his?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5049</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Answer me that.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5050</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You won it from him in a wager, during the tourney on Prince Joffrey&apos;s name day.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5051</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>When my brother Jaime was unhorsed by the Knight of Flowers, that was his story, no?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5052</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It was,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5053</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Riders!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5054</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ser Rodrik, Ser Willis, to horse,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5055</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Get the other mounts behind us.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5056</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Mohor, guard the prisonersâ€”</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5057</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Arm us!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5058</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You will need every sword.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5059</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I hear them!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5060</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Twenty men, maybe twenty-five,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5061</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Milk Snakes or Moon Brothers, by my guess.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5062</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They must have eyes out, m&apos;ladyâ€¦ hidden watchersâ€¦ they know we&apos;re here.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5063</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You, singer,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5064</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Help me with this breastplate.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5065</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You have no choice,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5066</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Three of us, and a fourth man wasted guarding usâ€¦ four men can be the difference between life and death up here.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5067</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Give me your word that you will put down your swords again after the fight is done.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5068</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My word?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5069</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, that you have, my ladyâ€¦ on my honor as a Lannister.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5070</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Arm them,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5071</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have never fought with an axe.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5072</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Pretend you&apos;re splitting logs,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5073</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Logs don&apos;t bleed,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5074</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Move over.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5075</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Go away!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5076</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m a singer, I want no part of this fight!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5077</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What, lost your taste for adventure?</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>Winterfell!</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Gods have mercy, I&apos;m bleeding.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5084</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I believe that&apos;s horse blood,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5085</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Close your eyes and pretend you&apos;re dead,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5086</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your first battle?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5087</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My father will be so proud,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5088</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You need a woman now,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5089</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Nothing like a woman after a man&apos;s been blooded, take my word.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5090</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m willing if she is,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5091</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lady Stark, I urge you to press on, with all haste,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5092</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We drove them off for the moment, but they will not have gone far.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5093</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We must bury our dead, Ser Willis,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5094</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>These were brave men.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5095</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I will not leave them to the crows and shadowcats.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5096</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This soil is too stony for digging,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5097</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Then we shall gather stones for cairns.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5098</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Gather all the stones you want,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5099</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>but do it without me or Chiggen.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5100</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ve better things to do than pile rocks on dead menâ€¦ breathing, for one.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5101</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Any of you who hope to be alive come nightfall, ride with us.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5102</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My lady, I fear he speaks the truth,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5103</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If we linger here, they will be on us again for a certainty, and we may not live through a second attack.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5104</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>May the gods forgive us, then.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5105</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We will ride at once.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5106</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ll take that dirk now, dwarf.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5107</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Let him keep it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5108</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And see that he has his axe back as well.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5109</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We may have need of it if we are attacked again.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>5110</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You have my thanks, lady,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5111</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Save them,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5112</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I trust you no more than I did before.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>5113</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Craven,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5114</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>rhymes nicely with raven.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5115</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>As I was saying before we were so rudely interrupted,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5116</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>there is a serious flaw in Littlefinger&apos;s fable.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>It is a terrible thing we contemplate, a vile thing.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>We ought to have had Viserys and his sister killed years ago, but His Grace my brother made the mistake of listening to Jon Arryn.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>On the Trident, Ser Barristan here cut down a dozen good men, Robert&apos;s friends and mine.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>When they brought him to us, grievously wounded and near death, Roose Bolton urged us to cut his throat, but your brother said, â€˜I will not kill a man for loyalty, nor for fighting well,â€™ and sent his own maester to tend Ser Barristan&apos;s wounds.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>5360</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Would that man were here today.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Ser Barristan was a knight of the Kingsguard.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>To put an end to Targaryens!</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Sadly, sadlyâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5381</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Forgive me, but I must stand with Lord Eddard.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>My order serves the realm, not the ruler.</quotetext>

	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5384</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yet I ask you thisâ€”should war come again, how many soldiers will die?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5385</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How many towns will burn?</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>How many children will be ripped from their mothers to perish on the end of a spear?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5387</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Is it not wiser, even kinder, that Daenerys Targaryen should die now so that tens of thousands might live?</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>5388</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Kinder,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Oh, well and truly spoken, Grand Maester.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>5390</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It is so true.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Do it yourself, Robert.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>The king and I have quarreled.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5438</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We shall be returning to Winterfell.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5439</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I shall begin making arrangements at once, my lord.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5440</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We will need a fortnight to ready everything for the journey.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5441</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We may not have a fortnight.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5442</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We may not have a day.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5443</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The king mentioned something about seeing my head on a spike.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5444</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It might be safest if I went on ahead,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5445</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I will take my daughters and a few guardsmen.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5446</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The rest of you can follow when you are ready.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5447</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Inform Jory, but tell no one else, and do nothing until the girls and I have gone.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5448</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The castle is full of eyes and ears, and I would rather my plans were not known.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5449</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>As you command, my lord.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5450</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Find me a fast ship with a skilled captain,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5451</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I care nothing for the size of its cabins or the quality of its appointments, so long as it is swift and safe.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5452</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I wish to leave at once.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5453</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Baelish to see you, m&apos;lord.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5454</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Show him in, Tom.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5455</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Might I ask the reason for this visit, Lord Baelish?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5456</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I won&apos;t detain you long, I&apos;m on my way to dine with Lady Tanda.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5457</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lamprey pie and roast suckling pig.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5458</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She has some thought to wed me to her younger daughter, so her table is always astonishing.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5459</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If truth be told, I&apos;d sooner marry the pig, but don&apos;t tell her.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5460</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I do love lamprey pie.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5461</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Don&apos;t let me keep you from your eels, my lord,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5462</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>At the moment, I cannot think of anyone whose company I desire less than yours.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5463</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, I&apos;m certain if you put your mind to it, you could come up with a few names.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5464</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Varys, say.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5465</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Cersei.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5466</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Or Robert.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5467</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>His Grace is most wroth with you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5468</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He went on about you at some length after you took your leave of us this morning.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5469</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The words insolence and ingratitude came into it frequently, I seem to recall.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5470</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>After you stormed out, it was left to me to convince them not to hire the Faceless Men,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5471</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Instead Varys will quietly let it be known that we&apos;ll make a lord of whoever does in the Targaryen girl.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5472</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So now we grant titles to assassins.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5473</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Titles are cheap.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5474</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Faceless Men are expensive.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5475</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If truth be told, I did the Targaryen girl more good than you with all your talk of honor.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5476</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Let some sellsword drunk on visions of lordship try to kill her.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5477</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Likely he&apos;ll make a botch of it, and afterward the Dothraki will be on their guard.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5478</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If we&apos;d sent a Faceless Man after her, she&apos;d be as good as buried.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5479</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You sit in council and talk of ugly women and steel kisses, and now you expect me to believe that you tried to protect the girl?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5480</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How big a fool do you take me for?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5481</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well, quite an enormous one, actually,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5482</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do you always find murder so amusing, Lord Baelish?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5483</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s not murder I find amusing, Lord Stark, it&apos;s you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5484</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You rule like a man dancing on rotten ice.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5485</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I daresay you will make a noble splash.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5486</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I believe I heard the first crack this morning.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5487</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The first and last,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5488</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ve had my fill.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5489</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>When do you mean to return to Winterfell, my lord?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5490</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>As soon as I can.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5491</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What concern is that of yours?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5492</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Noneâ€¦ but if perchance you&apos;re still here come evenfall, I&apos;d be pleased to take you to this brothel your man Jory has been searching for so ineffectually.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5493</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And I won&apos;t even tell the Lady Catelyn.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5494</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My lady, you should have sent word of your coming,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5495</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We would have sent an escort.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5496</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The high road is not as safe as it once was, for a party as small as yours.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5497</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We learned that to our sorrow, Ser Donnel,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5498</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The clansmen harried us day and night.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5499</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We lost three men in the first attack, and two more in the second, and Lannister&apos;s serving man died of a fever when his wounds festered.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5500</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>When we heard your men approaching, I thought us doomed for certain.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5501</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The clans have grown bolder since Lord Jon died,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5502</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If it were up to me, I would take a hundred men into the mountains, root them out of their fastnesses, and teach them some sharp lessons, but your sister has forbidden it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5503</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She would not even permit her knights to fight in the Hand&apos;s tourney.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5504</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She wants all our swords kept close to home, to defend the Valeâ€¦ against what, no one is certain.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5505</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Shadows, some say.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5506</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I hope I have not spoken out of turn, my lady.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5507</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I meant no offense.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5508</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Frank talk does not offend me, Ser Donnel.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5509</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>When we reach your keep, I would take it kindly if you could send for Maester Colemon at once.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5510</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ser Rodrik is feverish from his wounds.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5511</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Lady Lysa has commanded the maester to remain at the Eyrie at all times, to care for Lord Robert,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5512</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We have a septon at the gate who tends to our wounded.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5513</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He can see to your man&apos;s hurts.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5514</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Who would pass the Bloody Gate?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5515</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ser Donnel Waynwood, with the Lady Catelyn Stark and her companions,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5516</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I thought the lady looked familiar.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5517</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You are far from home, little Cat.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5518</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And you, Uncle,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5519</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My home is at my back,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5520</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your home is in my heart,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5521</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Take off your helm.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5522</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I would look on your face again.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5523</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The years have not improved it, I fear,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5524</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Did Lysa know you were coming?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5525</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There was no time to send word ahead,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5526</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I fear we ride before the storm, Uncle.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5527</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>May we enter the Vale?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5528</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>In the name of Robert Arryn, Lord of the Eyrie, Defender of the Vale, True Warden of the East, I bid you enter freely, and charge you to keep his peace,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5529</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Come.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5530</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s there, beside Alyssa&apos;s Tears.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5531</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>All you can see from here is a flash of white every now and then, if you look hard and the sun hits the walls just right.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5532</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How long a ride?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5533</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We can be at the mountain by evenfall,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5534</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>but the climb will take another day.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5535</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My lady,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5536</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I fear I can go no farther today.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5537</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Nor should you,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5538</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You have done all I could have asked of you, and a hundred times more.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5539</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My uncle will see me the rest of the way to the Eyrie.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5540</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lannister must come with me, but there is no reason that you and the others should not rest here and recover your strength.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5541</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We should be honored to have them to guest,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5542</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My lady,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5543</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I beg you allow me to accompany you to the Eyrie, to see the end of the tale as I saw its beginnings.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5544</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Very well,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5545</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ll come as well,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5546</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>As you wish,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5547</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So, child.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5548</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Tell me about this storm of yours.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5549</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have not been a child in many years, Uncle,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5550</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>the black goat of the Tully flock.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5551</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your father must be told,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5552</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If the Lannisters should march, Winterfell is remote and the Vale walled up behind its mountains, but Riverrun lies right in their path.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5553</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;d had the same fear,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5554</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I shall ask Maester Colemon to send a bird when we reach the Eyrie.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5555</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What is the mood in the Vale?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5556</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Angry,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5557</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Jon was much loved, and the insult was keenly felt when the king named Jaime Lannister to an office the Arryns had held for near three hundred years.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5558</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lysa has commanded us to call her son the True Warden of the East, but no one is fooled.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5559</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Nor is your sister alone in wondering at the manner of the Hand&apos;s death.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5560</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>None dare say Jon was murdered, not openly, but suspicion casts a long shadow.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5561</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And there is the boy.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5562</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The boy?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5563</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What of him?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5564</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Robert,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5565</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Six years old, sickly, and prone to weep if you take his dolls away.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5566</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Jon Arryn&apos;s trueborn heir, by all the gods, yet there are some who say he is too weak to sit his father&apos;s seat, Nestor Royce has been high steward these past fourteen years, while Lord Jon served in King&apos;s Landing, and many whisper that he should rule until the boy comes of age.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5567</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Others believe that Lysa must marry again, and soon.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5568</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Already the suitors gather like crows on a battlefield.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5569</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Eyrie is full of them.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5570</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I might have expected that,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5571</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Will Lysa take another husband?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5572</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She says yes, provided she finds a man who suits her,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5573</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>but she has already rejected Lord Nestor and a dozen other suitable men.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5574</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She swears that this time she will choose her lord husband.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5575</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You of all people can scarce fault her for that.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5576</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Nor do I, butâ€¦ it seems to me Lysa is only playing at courtship.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5577</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She enjoys the sport, but I believe your sister intends to rule herself until her boy is old enough to be Lord of the Eyrie in truth as well as name.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5578</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A woman can rule as wisely as a man,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5579</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The right woman can,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5580</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Make no mistake, Cat.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5581</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lysa is not you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5582</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If truth be told, I fear you may not find your sister as helpful as you would like.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5583</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What do you mean?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5584</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Lysa who came back from King&apos;s Landing is not the same girl who went south when her husband was named Hand.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5585</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Those years were hard for her.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5586</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You must know.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5587</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Arryn was a dutiful husband, but their marriage was made from politics, not passion.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5588</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>As was my own.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5589</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They began the same, but your ending has been happier than your sister&apos;s.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5590</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Two babes stillborn, twice as many miscarriages, Lord Arryn&apos;s deathâ€¦ Catelyn, the gods gave Lysa only the one child, and he is all your sister lives for now, poor boy.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5591</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Small wonder she fled rather than see him handed over to the Lannisters.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>Your sister is afraid, child, and the Lannisters are what she fears most.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5593</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She ran to the Vale, stealing away from the Red Keep like a thief in the night, and all to snatch her son out of the lion&apos;s mouthâ€¦ and now you have brought the lion to her door.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5594</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>In chains,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5595</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5596</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I see an axe on his saddle, a dirk at his belt, and a sellsword that trails after him like a hungry shadow.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5597</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Where are the chains, sweet one?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5598</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The dwarf is here, and not by choice.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5599</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Chains or no, he is my prisoner.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5600</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lysa will want him to answer for his crimes no less than I.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5601</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It was her own lord husband the Lannisters murdered, and her own letter that first warned us against them.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5602</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I hope you are right, child,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5603</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Gates of the Moon,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5604</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Nestor&apos;s seat.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5605</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He should be expecting us.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5606</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Look up.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5607</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Eyrie,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5608</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Arryns must not be overfond of company.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5609</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If you&apos;re planning to make us climb that mountain in the dark, I&apos;d rather you kill me here.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5610</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We&apos;ll spend the night here and make the ascent on the morrow,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5611</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I can scarcely wait,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5612</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How do we get up there?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5613</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ve no experience at riding goats.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5614</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Mules,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5615</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There are steps carved into the mountain,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5616</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It is too dark to see them, but the steps are there.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5617</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Too steep and narrow for horses, but mules can manage them most of the way.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5618</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The path is guarded by three waycastles, Stone and Snow and Sky.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5619</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The mules will take us as far up as Sky.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5620</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And beyond that?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5621</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Beyond that, the path is too steep even for mules.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5622</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We ascend on foot the rest of the way.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5623</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Or perchance you&apos;d prefer to ride a basket.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5624</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Eyrie clings to the mountain directly above Sky, and in its cellars are six great winches with long iron chains to draw supplies up from below.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5625</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If you prefer, my lord of Lannister, I can arrange for you to ride up with the bread and beer and apples.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5626</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Would that I were a pumpkin,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5627</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Alas, my lord father would no doubt be most chagrined if his son of Lannister went to his fate like a load of turnips.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5628</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If you ascend on foot, I fear I must do the same.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5629</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We Lannisters do have a certain pride.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5630</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Pride?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5631</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Arrogance, some might call it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5632</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Arrogance and avarice and lust for power.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5633</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My brother is undoubtedly arrogant,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5634</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My father is the soul of avarice, and my sweet sister Cersei lusts for power with every waking breath.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5635</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I, however, am innocent as a little lamb.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5636</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Shall I bleat for you?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5637</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lady Stark,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5638</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Nestor,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5639</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We have had a long and tiring journey.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5640</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I would beg the hospitality of your roof tonight, if I might.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5641</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My roof is yours, my lady,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5642</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>but your sister the Lady Lysa has sent down word from the Eyrie.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5643</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She wishes to see you at once.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5644</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The rest of your party will be housed here and sent up at first light.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5645</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What madness is this?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5646</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A night ascent, with the moon not even full?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5647</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Even Lysa should know that&apos;s an invitation to a broken neck.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5648</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The mules know the way, Ser Brynden.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5649</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I promise you, my lady, no harm will come to you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5650</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It would be my honor to take you up.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5651</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ve made the dark climb a hundred times.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5652</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Mychel says my father must have been a goat.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5653</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do you have a name, child?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5654</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Mya Stone, if it please you, my lady,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5655</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Mya&apos;s a clever girl, and if she vows she will bring you safely to the Lady Lysa, I believe her.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5656</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She has not failed me yet.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5657</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Then I put myself in your hands, Mya Stone,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5658</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Nestor, I charge you to keep a close guard on my prisoner.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5659</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And I charge you to bring the prisoner a cup of wine and a nicely crisped capon, before he dies of hunger,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5660</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A girl would be pleasant as well, but I suppose that&apos;s too much to ask of you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5661</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>As you say, my lady, so it will be done.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5662</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>See our lord of Lannister to a tower cell, and bring him meat and mead.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5663</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Some people find it easier if they close their eyes,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5664</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>When they get frightened or dizzy, sometimes they hold on to the mule too tight.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5665</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They don&apos;t like that.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5666</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I was born a Tully and wed to a Stark,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5667</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I do not frighten easily.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5668</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do you plan to light a torch?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5669</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Torches just blind you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5670</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>On a clear night like this, the moon and the stars are enough.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5671</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Mychel says I have the eyes of the owl.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5672</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You mentioned Mychel before,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5673</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Mychel&apos;s my love,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5674</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Mychel Redfort.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5675</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He&apos;s squire to Ser Lyn Corbray.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5676</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We&apos;re to wed as soon as he becomes a knight, next year or the year after.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5677</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Stone,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5678</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You don&apos;t want your mule to break a leg up here,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5679</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We ought to keep going, my lady,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5680</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If it please you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5681</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Whitey&apos;s a good one, my lady.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5682</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Sure of foot, even on ice, but you need to be careful.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5683</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He&apos;ll kick if he doesn&apos;t like you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5684</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My mother says that hundreds of years ago, this was where the snow began,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5685</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It was always white above here, and the ice never melted.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5686</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I can&apos;t remember ever seeing snow this far down the mountain, but maybe it was that way once, in the olden times.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5687</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s best to lead the mules over,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5688</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The wind can be a little scary here, my lady.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5689</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lady Stark,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5690</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Are you well?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5691</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Iâ€¦ I cannot do this, child,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5692</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes you can,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5693</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I know you can.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5694</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Look how wide the path is.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5695</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I don&apos;t want to look.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5696</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ll come back for you,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5697</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Don&apos;t move, my lady.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5698</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Keep your eyes closed if you like.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5699</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Let go of the rope now, Whitey will take care of himself.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5700</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Very good, my lady.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5701</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ll lead you over, it&apos;s easy, you&apos;ll see.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5702</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Give me a step now.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5703</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That&apos;s it, move your foot, just slide it forward.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5704</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>See.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5705</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Now another.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5706</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Easy.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5707</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You could run across.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5708</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Another one, go on.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5709</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5710</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The stables and barracks are in there,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5711</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The last part is inside the mountain.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5712</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It can be a little dark, but at least you&apos;re out of the wind.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5713</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This is as far as the mules can go.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5714</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Past here, well, it&apos;s a sort of chimney, more like a stone ladder than proper steps, but it&apos;s not too bad.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5715</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Another hour and we&apos;ll be there.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5716</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Lannisters may have their pride,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5717</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>but the Tullys are born with better sense.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5718</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have ridden all day and the best part of a night.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5719</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Tell them to lower a basket.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5720</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I shall ride with the turnips.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5721</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lady Stark,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5722</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>the pleasure is as great as it is unanticipated.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5723</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Indeed it is, my lady, indeed it is.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5724</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have sent word to your sister.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5725</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She left orders to be awakened the instant you arrived.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5726</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I hope she had a good night&apos;s rest,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5727</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Cat,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>Oh, Cat, how good it is to see you.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>5729</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My sweet sister.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>5730</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How long it has been,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5731</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, how very very long.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5732</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You look well,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5733</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>butâ€¦ tired.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5734</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Tired.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5735</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5736</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, yes.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5737</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Leave us,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5738</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I wish to speak to my sister alone.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5739</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Have you taken leave of your senses?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5740</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>To bring him here, without a word of permission, without so much as a warning, to drag us into your quarrels with the Lannistersâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5741</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My quarrels?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5742</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They were your quarrels first, sister.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5743</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It was you who sent me that cursed letter, you who wrote that the Lannisters had murdered your husband.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5744</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>To warn you, so you could stay away from them!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5745</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I never meant to fight them!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5746</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Gods, Cat, do you know what you&apos;ve done?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5747</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Mother?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5748</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I heard voices.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5749</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This is your aunt Catelyn, baby.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5750</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My sister, Lady Stark.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5751</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do you remember?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5752</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I think so,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5753</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Come to Mother, my sweet one.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5754</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Isn&apos;t he beautiful?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5755</quoteindex>

		<quotetext>The seed is strong, he told me.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5758</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>His last words.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5759</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He kept saying Robert&apos;s name, and he grabbed my arm so hard he left marks.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5760</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Tell them, the seed is strong.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5761</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>His seed.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5762</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He wanted everyone to know what a good strong boy my baby was going to be.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5763</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lysa,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5764</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>if you&apos;re right about the Lannisters, all the more reason we must act quickly.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5765</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Weâ€”</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5766</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Not in front of the baby,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5767</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He has a delicate temper, don&apos;t you, sweet one?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5768</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The boy is Lord of the Eyrie and Defender of the Vale,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5769</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>and these are no times for delicacy.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Even if they could bring an army through the mountains and past the Bloody Gate, the Eyrie is impregnable.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Everyone says so.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5785</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The only thing is, what am I to do with this Imp you have brought me?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5786</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Is he a bad man?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5787</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A very bad man,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5788</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>but Mother won&apos;t let him harm my little baby.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>5789</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Make him fly,</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>5790</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Perhaps we will,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Perhaps that is just what we will do.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5792</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s time we took our leave.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Your business,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>They say the Hand dreams the king&apos;s dreams, speaks with the king&apos;s voice, and rules with the king&apos;s sword.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5799</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Does that also mean you fuck with the king&apos;sâ€”</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5800</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Baelish,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5801</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>you presume too much.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5802</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I am not ungrateful for your help.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5803</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It might have taken us years to find this brothel without you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5804</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That does not mean I intend to endure your mockery.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5805</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And I am no longer the King&apos;s Hand.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5806</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The direwolf must be a prickly beast,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5807</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Will we be going back to the castle now, my lord?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5808</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Chataya runs a choice establishment,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5809</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ve half a mind to buy it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5810</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Brothels are a much sounder investment than ships, I&apos;ve found.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Whores seldom sink, and when they are boarded by pirates, why, the pirates pay good coin like everyone else.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Robert will never keep to one bed,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5813</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I hear he has gotten a child on some girl in the Vale.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5814</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Love is sweet, dearest Ned, but it cannot change a man&apos;s nature.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5815</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I named her Barra,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5816</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She looks so like him, does she not, milord?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5817</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She has his nose, and his hairâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5818</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She does.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5819</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Tell him that when you see him, milord, as itâ€¦ as it please you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5820</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Tell him how beautiful she is.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5821</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I will,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5822</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And tell him I&apos;ve not been with no one else.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5823</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I swear it, milord, by the old gods and new.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5824</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Chataya said I could have half a year, for the baby, and for hoping he&apos;d come back.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5825</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So you&apos;ll tell him I&apos;m waiting, won&apos;t you?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5826</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I don&apos;t want no jewels or nothing, just him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5827</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He was always good to me, truly.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5828</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I will tell him, child, and I promise you, Barra shall not go wanting.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5829</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Baelish, what do you know of Robert&apos;s bastards?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5830</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well, he has more than you, for a start.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5831</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How many?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5832</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Does it matter?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5833</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If you bed enough women, some will give you presents, and His Grace has never been shy on that count.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5834</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I know he&apos;s acknowledged that boy at Storm&apos;s End, the one he fathered the night Lord Stannis wed.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5835</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He could hardly do otherwise.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5836</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The mother was a Florent, niece to the Lady Selyse, one of her bedmaids.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5837</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Renly says that Robert carried the girl upstairs during the feast, and broke in the wedding bed while Stannis and his bride were still dancing.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5838</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Stannis seemed to think that was a blot on the honor of his wife&apos;s House, so when the boy was born, he shipped him off to Renly.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5839</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ve also heard whispers that Robert got a pair of twins on a serving wench at Casterly Rock, three years ago when he went west for Lord Tywin&apos;s tourney.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5840</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Cersei had the babes killed, and sold the mother to a passing slaver.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5841</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Too much an affront to Lannister pride, that close to home.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5842</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why would Jon Arryn take a sudden interest in the king&apos;s baseborn children?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5843</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He was the King&apos;s Hand.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5844</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Doubtless Robert asked him to see that they were provided for.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5845</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It had to be more than that, or why kill him?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5846</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Now I see.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5847</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Arryn learned that His Grace had filled the bellies of some whores and fishwives, and for that he had to be silenced.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5848</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Small wonder.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5849</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Allow a man like that to live, and next he&apos;s like to blurt out that the sun rises in the east.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5850</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My lord,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5851</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Behind!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5852</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Make way or die!</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>5853</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The wolves are howling,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5854</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Such a small pack, though.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5855</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What is the meaning of this?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5856</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This is the Hand of the King.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5857</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He was the Hand of the King.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5858</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Now, if truth be told, I&apos;m not sure what he is.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5859</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lannister, this is madness,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5860</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Let us pass.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5861</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We are expected back at the castle.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5862</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What do you think you&apos;re doing?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5863</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He knows what he&apos;s doing,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5864</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Quite true.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5865</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m looking for my brother.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5866</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You remember my brother, don&apos;t you, Lord Stark?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5867</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He was with us at Winterfell.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5868</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Fair-haired, mismatched eyes, sharp of tongue.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5869</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A short man.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5870</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I remember him well,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5871</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It would seem he has met some trouble on the road.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5872</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My lord father is quite vexed.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5873</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You would not perchance have any notion of who might have wished my brother ill, would you?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5874</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your brother has been taken at my command, to answer for his crimes,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5875</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My lordsâ€”</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5876</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Show me your steel, Lord Eddard.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5877</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ll butcher you like Aerys if I must, but I&apos;d sooner you died with a blade in your hand.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5878</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Baelish, I&apos;d leave here in some haste if I did not care to get bloodstains on my costly clothing.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5879</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I will bring the City Watch,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5880</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Kill me,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5881</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>and Catelyn will most certainly slay Tyrion.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5882</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Would she?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5883</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The noble Catelyn Tully of Riverrun murder a hostage?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5884</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I thinkâ€¦ not.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5885</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But I am not willing to chance my brother&apos;s life on a woman&apos;s honor.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5886</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So I suppose I&apos;ll let you run back to Robert to tell him how I frightened you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5887</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I wonder if he&apos;ll care.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>Tregar, see that no harm comes to Lord Stark.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>As you say, m&apos;lord.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>Stillâ€¦ we wouldn&apos;t want him to leave here entirely unchastened, so</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>5891</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>kill his men.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>5901</quoteindex>

		<quotetext>They do know how to kill.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>The black crows got no place for women.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>6230</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Give her to the wolves,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>A leg of lamb would be pleasant,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6242</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Perhaps a dish of peas and onions, some fresh baked bread with butter, and a flagon of mulled wine to wash it down.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6243</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Or beer, if that&apos;s easier.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>No doubt she does, but what makes you think I wish to see her?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6339</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your wishes are not my concern.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>6341</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A cold night,</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6345</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My cloak,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6346</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The shadowskin you took from me for safekeeping.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>My thanks.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>I shall think of you whenever I wear it.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Lead on, Ser Vardis.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6352</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You wish to confess your crimes, we are told.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6353</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I do, my lady,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6354</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The sky cells always break them.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6355</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The gods can see them there, and there is no darkness to hide in.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6356</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He does not look broken to me,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6357</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Say what you will,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6358</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Where to begin?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6359</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I am a vile little man, I confess it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6360</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My crimes and sins are beyond counting, my lords and ladies.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6361</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have lain with whores, not once but hundreds of times.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6362</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have wished my own lord father dead, and my sister, our gracious queen, as well.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6363</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have not always treated my servants with kindness.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6364</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have gambled.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6365</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have even cheated, I blush to admit.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6366</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have said many cruel and malicious things about the noble lords and ladies of the court.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6367</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Once Iâ€”</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6368</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Silence!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6369</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What do you imagine you are doing, dwarf?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6370</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why, confessing my crimes, my ladyâ€”</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6371</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You are accused of sending a hired knife to slay my son Bran in his bed, and of conspiring to murder Lord Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6372</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Those crimes I cannot confess, I fear.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6373</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I know nothing of any murders.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6374</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I will not be made mock of.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6375</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You have had your little jape, Imp.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6376</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I trust you enjoyed it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6377</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ser Vardis, take him back to the dungeonâ€¦ but this time find him a smaller cell, with a floor more sharply sloped.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6378</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Is this how justice is done in the Vale?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6379</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Does honor stop at the Bloody Gate?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6380</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You accuse me of crimes, I deny them, so you throw me into an open cell to freeze and starve.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6381</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Where is the king&apos;s justice?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6382</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Is the Eyrie not part of the Seven Kingdoms?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6383</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I stand accused, you say.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6384</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Very well.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6385</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I demand a trial!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6386</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Let me speak, and let my truth or falsehood be judged openly, in the sight of gods and men.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6387</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If you are tried and found to be guilty of the crimes for which you stand accused, then by the king&apos;s own laws, you must pay with your life&apos;s blood.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6388</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We keep no headsman in the Eyrie, my lord of Lannister.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6389</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Open the Moon Door.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6390</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Behold the king&apos;s justice,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6391</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lysa, I think this unwise,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6392</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You want a trial, my lord of Lannister.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6393</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Very well, a trial you shall have.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6394</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My son will listen to whatever you care to say, and you shall hear his judgment.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6395</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Then you may leaveâ€¦ by one door or the other.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6396</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I thank you, my good lady, but I see no need to trouble Lord Robert,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6397</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The gods know the truth of my innocence.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6398</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I will have their verdict, not the judgment of men.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6399</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I demand trial by combat.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6400</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You have that right, to be sure.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6401</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My lady, I beg the boon of championing your cause.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6402</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The honor should be mine,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6403</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>For the love I bore your lord husband, let me avenge his death.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6404</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My father served Lord Jon faithfully as High Steward of the Vale,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6405</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Let me serve his son in this.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6406</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The gods favor the man with the just cause,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6407</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>yet often that turns out to be the man with the surest sword.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6408</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We all know who that is.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6409</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I thank you, my lords, as I know my son would thank you if he were among us.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6410</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No men in the Seven Kingdoms are as bold and true as the knights of the Vale.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6411</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Would that I could grant you all this honor.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6412</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yet I can choose only one.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>6415</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My lady,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6416</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>pray give this burden to another, I have no taste for it.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>6417</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The man is no warrior.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6418</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Look at him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6419</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A dwarf, half my size and lame in the legs.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6420</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It would be shameful to slaughter such a man and call it justice.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6421</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I agree.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6422</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You demanded a trial by combat.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6423</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And now I demand a champion, such as you have chosen for yourself.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6424</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My brother Jaime will gladly take my part, I know.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>6425</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your precious Kingslayer is hundreds of leagues from here,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Singer,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6430</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>when you make a ballad of this, be certain you tell them how Lady Arryn denied the dwarf the right to a champion, and sent him forth lame and bruised and hobbling to face her finest knight.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6431</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I deny you nothing!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6432</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Name your champion, Impâ€¦ if you think you can find a man to die for you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6433</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If it is all the same to you, I&apos;d sooner find one to kill for me.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6434</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ll stand for the dwarf,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>I looked for you on the Trident,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>We were not there,</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>6438</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>When King&apos;s Landing fell, Ser Jaime slew your king with a golden sword, and I wondered where you were.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6439</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Far away,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6440</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>or Aerys would yet sit the Iron Throne, and our false brother would burn in seven hells.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6441</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I came down on Storm&apos;s End to lift the siege,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6442</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>and the Lords Tyrell and Redwyne dipped their banners, and all their knights bent the knee to pledge us fealty.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6443</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I was certain you would be among them.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>6446</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I thought you might have sailed with him.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Ser Willem is a good man and true,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6448</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But not of the Kingsguard,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>My lord,</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>Tell him I&apos;m too weak to come to him.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>From the Arbor.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>6510</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A good vintage.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>A small cup,</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>6512</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My head is still heavy from the milk of the poppy.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Who do you think you are?</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Charged by your own lord husband to keep the king&apos;s peace and enforce the king&apos;s justice.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>You were the Hand,</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>6528</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>but nowâ€”</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6529</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Silence!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6530</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You asked him a question and he answered it.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Tregar died this morning, of the blow Lord Stark gave him.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>6536</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Abductions on the kingsroad and drunken slaughter in my streets,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>I will not have it, Ned.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Catelyn had good reason for taking the Impâ€”</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>6539</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I said, I will not have it!</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>To hell with her reasons.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6541</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You will command her to release the dwarf at once, and you will make your peace with Jaime.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6542</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Three of my men were butchered before my eyes, because Jaime Lannister wished to chasten me.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Am I to forget that?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6544</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My brother was not the cause of this quarrel,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Lord Stark was returning drunk from a brothel.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6546</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>His men attacked Jaime and his guards, even as his wife attacked Tyrion on the kingsroad.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>You know me better than that, Robert,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>I&apos;ve talked to Littlefinger,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>He claims he rode off to bring the gold cloaks before the fighting began, but he admits you were returning from some whorehouse.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Some whorehouse?</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Her mother has named her Barra.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Barra,</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>6559</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I thought she had more sense.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>She cannot be more than fifteen, and a whore, and you thought she had sense?</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>6561</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The fool child is in love with you, Robert.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>This is no fit subject for the queen&apos;s ears.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Now it ends.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>My loving wife.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>The mother of my children.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>I should not have hit her.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>That was notâ€¦ that was not kingly.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6590</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I was always strongâ€¦ no one could stand before me, no one.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>How do you fight someone if you can&apos;t hit them?</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>6592</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Rhaegarâ€¦ Rhaegar won, damn him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6593</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I killed him, Ned, I drove the spike right through that black armor into his black heart, and he died at my feet.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6594</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They made up songs about it.</quotetext>

	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6612</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6613</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why not?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6614</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Someone has to rule this damnable kingdom.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6615</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Put on the badge, Ned.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6616</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It suits you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6617</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And if you ever throw it in my face again, I swear to you, I&apos;ll pin the damned thing on Jaime Lannister.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6618</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Tell me the rest of it,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6619</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Kingslayer is massing a host at Casterly Rock,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6620</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your brother writes that he has sent riders to the Rock, demanding that Lord Tywin proclaim his intent, but he has had no answer.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6621</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Edmure has commanded Lord Vance and Lord Piper to guard the pass below the Golden Tooth.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6622</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He vows to you that he will yield no foot of Tully land without first watering it with Lannister blood.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6623</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Edmure has sent riders and made vows,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6624</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>but Edmure is not the Lord of Riverrun.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6625</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What of my lord father?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6626</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The message made no mention of Lord Hoster, my lady.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6627</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My father would not have given the defense of Riverrun over to Edmure unless he was very sick,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6628</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I should have been woken as soon as this bird arrived.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6629</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your lady sister thought it better to let you sleep, Maester Colemon told me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6630</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I should have been woken,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6631</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The maester tells me your sister planned to speak with you after the combat,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6632</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Then she still plans to go through with this mummer&apos;s farce?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6633</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The dwarf has played her like a set of pipes, and she is too deaf to hear the tune.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6634</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Whatever happens this morning, Ser Rodrik, it is past time we took our leave.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6635</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My place is at Winterfell with my sons.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6636</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If you are strong enough to travel, I shall ask Lysa for an escort to see us to Gulltown.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6637</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We can take ship from there.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6638</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Another ship?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6639</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>As you say, my lady.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6640</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lannister is my prisoner,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6641</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My sister must be reminded of that.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6642</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Going to join the fool&apos;s festival?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6643</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;d tell you to slap some sense into your sister, if I thought it would do any good, but you&apos;d only bruise your hand.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6644</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There was a bird from Riverrun,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6645</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>a letter from Edmureâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6646</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I know, child.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6647</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I had to hear it from Maester Colemon.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6648</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I asked your sister for leave to take a thousand seasoned men and ride for Riverrun with all haste.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6649</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do you know what she told me?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6650</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Vale cannot spare a thousand swords, nor even one, Uncle, she said.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6651</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You are the Knight of the Gate.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6652</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your place is here.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6653</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well, I told her she could bloody well find herself a new Knight of the Gate.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6654</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Black fish or no, I am still a Tully.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6655</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I shall leave for Riverrun by evenfall.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6656</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Alone?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6657</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You know as well as I that you will never survive the high road.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6658</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ser Rodrik and I are returning to Winterfell.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6659</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Come with us, Uncle.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6660</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I will give you your thousand men.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6661</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Riverrun will not fight alone.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6662</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>As you say.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6663</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s the long way home, but I&apos;m more like to get there.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6664</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ll wait for you below.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6665</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Isn&apos;t it a lovely morning?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6666</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The gods are smiling on us.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6667</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do try a cup of the wine, sweet sister.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6668</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Hunter was kind enough to send for it, from his own cellars.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6669</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Thank you, no.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6670</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lysa, we must talk.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6671</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>After,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6672</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Now.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6673</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lysa, you cannot mean to go ahead with this folly.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6674</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Alive, the Imp has value.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6675</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Dead, he is only food for crows.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6676</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And if his champion should prevail hereâ€”</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6677</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Small chance of that, my lady,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6678</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ser Vardis is a doughty fighter.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6679</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He will make short work of the sellsword.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6680</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Will he, my lord?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6681</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I wonder.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6682</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Women understand little of these things,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6683</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ser Vardis is a knight, sweet lady.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6684</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This other fellow, well, his sort are all cowards at heart.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6685</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Useful enough in a battle, with thousands of their fellows around them, but stand them up alone and the manhood leaks right out of them.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6686</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Say you have the truth of it, then,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6687</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What will we gain by the dwarf&apos;s death?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6688</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do you imagine that Jaime will care a fig that we gave his brother a trial before we flung him off a mountain?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6689</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Behead the man,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6690</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>When the Kingslayer receives the Imp&apos;s head, it will be a warning to him,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6691</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Robert wants to see him fly,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6692</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And the Imp has only himself to blame.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6693</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It was he who demanded a trial by combat.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6694</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lady Lysa had no honorable way to deny him, even if she&apos;d wished to,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6695</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I remind you, Tyrion Lannister is my prisoner.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6696</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And I remind you, the dwarf murdered my lord husband!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6697</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He poisoned the Hand of the King and left my sweet baby fatherless, and now I mean to see him pay!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6698</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do you think he did?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6699</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Murder Lord Jon, that is?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6700</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Imp still denies it, and most fiercelyâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6701</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I believe the Lannisters murdered Lord Arryn,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6702</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>but whether it was Tyrion, or Ser Jaime, or the queen, or all of them together, I could not begin to say.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6703</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Poison, wellâ€¦ that could be the dwarf&apos;s work, true enough.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6704</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Or Cersei&apos;s.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6705</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s said poison is a woman&apos;s weapon, begging your pardons, my lady.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6706</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Kingslayer, nowâ€¦ I have no great liking for the man, but he&apos;s not the sort.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6707</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Too fond of the sight of blood on that golden sword of his.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6708</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Was it poison, my lady?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6709</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How else could they make it look a natural death?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6710</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The boy is utterly without discipline.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6711</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He will never be strong enough to rule unless he is taken away from his mother for a time.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6712</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>His lord father agreed with you,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6713</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He was planning to send the boy to Dragonstone for fostering, you knowâ€¦ oh, but I&apos;m speaking out of turn.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6714</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I fear I&apos;ve had too much of Lord Hunter&apos;s excellent wine.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6715</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The prospect of bloodshed has my nerves all a-frayâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6716</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You are mistaken, Maester,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6717</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It was Casterly Rock, not Dragonstone, and those arrangements were made after the Hand&apos;s death, without my sister&apos;s consent.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6718</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No, begging your forgiveness, my lady, but it was Lord Jon whoâ€”</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6719</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The bad little man,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6720</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Mother, can I make him fly?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6721</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I want to see him fly.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6722</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Later, my sweet baby,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6723</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Trial first,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6724</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>then execution.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6725</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>When are they going to fight?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6726</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I had that sword crafted for Jon in King&apos;s Landing,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6727</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He wore it whenever he sat the Iron Throne in King Robert&apos;s place.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6728</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Isn&apos;t it a lovely thing?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6729</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I thought it only fitting that our champion avenge Jon with his own blade.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6730</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Make them fight!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6731</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>For the Eyrie and the Vale!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6732</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They await your command,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6733</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Fight!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6734</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The man is craven,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6735</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Stand and fight, coward!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6736</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He wants to make Ser Vardis chase him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6737</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The weight of armor and shield will tire even the strongest man.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6738</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He is only a foolish boy, but I have loved him like a brother.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6739</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It would grieve me to see him die.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6740</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yield!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6741</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Cat</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6742</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They&apos;re not fighting good, Mother,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>You&apos;re certain to be a builder, and Jon&apos;s certain to be a ranger.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6809</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He&apos;s the best sword and the best rider among us, and his uncle was the First before heâ€¦</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6815</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Sam,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6816</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He was not at table tonight.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6817</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s not like him to miss a meal,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6818</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do you suppose he&apos;s taken ill?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6819</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He&apos;s frightened.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6820</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We&apos;re leaving him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6821</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Once we say our words, we&apos;ll all have duties to attend to.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6822</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Some of us may be sent away, to Eastwatch or the Shadow Tower.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6823</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Sam will remain in training, with the likes of Rast and Cuger and these new boys who are coming up the kingsroad.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6824</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Gods only know what they&apos;ll be like, but you can bet Ser Alliser will send them against him, first chance he gets.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6825</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You did all you could.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6826</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>All we could wasn&apos;t enough,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6827</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have not sworn yet,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6828</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I need to speak to Maester Aemon,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6829</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The maester is abed, as you should be.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6830</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Come back on the morrow and maybe he&apos;ll see you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6831</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I need to speak to him now.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6832</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The morning will be too late.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6833</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The maester is not accustomed to being woken in the night.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6834</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do you know how old he is?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6835</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Old enough to treat visitors with more courtesy than you,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6836</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Give him my pardons.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6837</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I would not disturb his rest if it were not important.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6838</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And if I refuse?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6839</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I can stand here all night if I must.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6840</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Wait in the library.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6841</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There&apos;s wood.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6842</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Start a fire.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6843</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I won&apos;t have the maester catching a chill on account of you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6844</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The chair beside the fire would be pleasant,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6845</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I am sorry to have woken you, Maester,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6846</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You did not wake me,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6847</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I find I need less sleep as I grow older, and I am grown very old.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6848</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I often spend half the night with ghosts, remembering times fifty years past as if they were yesterday.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6849</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The mystery of a midnight visitor is a welcome diversion.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6850</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So tell me, Jon Snow, why have you come calling at this strange hour?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6851</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>To ask that Samwell Tarly be taken from training and accepted as a brother of the Night&apos;s Watch.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6852</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This is no concern of Maester Aemon,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6853</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Our Lord Commander has given the training of recruits into the hands of Ser Alliser Thorne,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6854</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Only he may say when a boy is ready to swear his vow, as you surely know.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6855</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why then come to me?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6856</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Lord Commander listens to you,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6857</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And the wounded and the sick of the Night&apos;s Watch are in your charge.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6858</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And is your friend Samwell wounded or sick?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6859</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He will be,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6860</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>unless you help.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6861</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Without us to keep him safe, Sam will have no chance,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6862</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He&apos;s hopeless with a sword.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6863</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My sister Arya could tear him apart, and she&apos;s not yet ten.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6864</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If Ser Alliser makes him fight, it&apos;s only a matter of time before he&apos;s hurt or killed.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6865</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ve seen this fat boy in the common hall,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6866</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He is a pig, and a hopeless craven as well, if what you say is true.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6867</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Maybe it is so,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6868</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Tell me, Chett, what would you have us do with such a boy?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6869</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Leave him where he is,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6870</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Wall is no place for the weak.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6871</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Let him train until he is ready, no matter how many years that takes.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6872</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ser Alliser shall make a man of him or kill him, as the gods will.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6873</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That&apos;s stupid,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6874</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I remember once I asked Maester Luwin why he wore a chain around his throat.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6875</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Go on.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6876</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He told me that a maester&apos;s collar is made of chain to remind him that he is sworn to serve,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6877</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I asked why each link was a different metal.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6878</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A silver chain would look much finer with his grey robes, I said.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6879</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Maester Luwin laughed.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6880</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A maester forges his chain with study, he told me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6881</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The different metals are each a different kind of learning, gold for the study of money and accounts, silver for healing, iron for warcraft.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6882</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And he said there were other meanings as well.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6883</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The collar is supposed to remind a maester of the realm he serves, isn&apos;t that so?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6884</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lords are gold and knights steel, but two links can&apos;t make a chain.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6885</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You also need silver and iron and lead, tin and copper and bronze and all the rest, and those are farmers and smiths and merchants and the like.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6886</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A chain needs all sorts of metals, and a land needs all sorts of people.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6887</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And so?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6888</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Night&apos;s Watch needs all sorts too.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6889</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why else have rangers and stewards and builders?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6890</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Randyll couldn&apos;t make Sam a warrior, and Ser Alliser won&apos;t either.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6891</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You can&apos;t hammer tin into iron, no matter how hard you beat it, but that doesn&apos;t mean tin is useless.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6892</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why shouldn&apos;t Sam be a steward?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6893</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m a steward.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6894</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You think it&apos;s easy work, fit for cowards?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6895</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The order of stewards keeps the Watch alive.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6896</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We hunt and farm, tend the horses, milk the cows, gather firewood, cook the meals.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6897</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Who do you think makes your clothing?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6898</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Who brings up supplies from the south?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6899</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The stewards.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6900</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Is your friend a hunter?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6901</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He hates hunting,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6902</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Can he plow a field?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6903</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Can he drive a wagon or sail a ship?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6904</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Could he butcher a cow?</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>I&apos;ve seen what happens to soft lordlings when they&apos;re put to work.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6907</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Set them to churning butter and their hands blister and bleed.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>Give them an axe to split logs, and they cut off their own foot.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>I know one thing Sam could do better than anyone.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Yes?</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>6911</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He could help you,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6912</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He can do sums, and he knows how to read and write.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6913</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I know Chett can&apos;t read, and Clydas has weak eyes.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Sam read every book in his father&apos;s library.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6915</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He&apos;d be good with the ravens too.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Animals seem to like him.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Ghost took to him straight off.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Does that meanâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6925</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It means I shall think on what you have said,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>And now, I believe I am ready to sleep.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>Chett, show our young brother to the door.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>6928</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Will this do?</quotetext>

		<quotetext>A fire?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6932</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Are you so hungry to die, dwarf?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6933</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Or have you taken leave of your senses?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6934</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A fire will bring the clansmen down on us from miles around.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6935</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I mean to survive this journey, Lannister.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6936</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And how do you hope to do that?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6937</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We have no chance of fighting our way back,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6938</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>but two can cover more ground than ten, and attract less notice.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6939</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The fewer days we spend in these mountains, the more like we are to reach the riverlands.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6940</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ride hard and fast, I say.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6941</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Travel by night and hole up by day, avoid the road where we can, make no noise and light no fires.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6942</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A splendid plan, Bronn.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6943</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Try it, as you likeâ€¦ and forgive me if I do not linger to bury you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6944</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You think to outlive me, dwarf?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6945</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Riding hard and fast by night is a sure way to tumble down a mountain and crack your skull.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6946</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I prefer to make my crossing slow and easy.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6947</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I know you love the taste of horse, Bronn, but if our mounts die under us this time, we&apos;ll be trying to saddle shadowcatsâ€¦ and if truth be told, I think the clans will find us no matter what we do.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6948</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Their eyes are all around us.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6949</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Then we&apos;re dead men, Lannister.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6950</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If so, I prefer to die comfortable,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6951</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We need a fire.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6952</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The nights are cold up here, and hot food will warm our bellies and lift our spirits.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6953</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do you suppose there&apos;s any game to be had?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6954</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lady Lysa has kindly provided us with a veritable feast of salt beef, hard cheese, and stale bread, but I would hate to break a tooth so far from the nearest maester.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6955</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I can find meat.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6956</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I should leave you here with your fool&apos;s fire.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6957</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If I took your horse, I&apos;d have twice the chance to make it through.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6958</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What would you do then, dwarf?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6959</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Die, most like.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6960</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You don&apos;t think I&apos;d do it?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6961</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;d do it in an instant, if it meant your life.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6962</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You were quick enough to silence your friend Chiggen when he caught that arrow in his belly.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6963</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He was good as dead,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6964</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>and his moaning was bringing them down on us.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6965</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Chiggen would have done the same for meâ€¦ and he was no friend, only a man I rode with.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6966</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Make no mistake, dwarf.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6967</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I fought for you, but I do not love you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6968</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It was your blade I needed,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6969</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>not your love.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6970</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;re bold as any sellsword, I&apos;ll give you that.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6971</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How did you know I&apos;d take your part?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6972</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Know?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6973</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I tossed the dice.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6974</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Back at the inn, you and Chiggen helped take me captive.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6975</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6976</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The others saw it as their duty, for the honor of the lords they served, but not you two.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6977</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You had no lord, no duty, and precious little honor, so why trouble to involve yourselves?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6978</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well, why do sellswords do anything?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6979</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>For gold.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6980</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You were thinking Lady Catelyn would reward you for your help, perhaps even take you into her service.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6981</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Here, that should do, I hope.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6982</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do you have a flint?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6983</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My thanks,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6984</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The thing is, you did not know the Starks.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6985</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Eddard is a proud, honorable, and honest man, and his lady wife is worse.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6986</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, no doubt she would have found a coin or two for you when this was all over, and pressed it in your hand with a polite word and a look of distaste, but that&apos;s the most you could have hoped for.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6987</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Starks look for courage and loyalty and honor in the men they choose to serve them, and if truth be told, you and Chiggen were lowborn scum.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6988</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You have a bold tongue, little man.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6989</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>One day someone is like to cut it out and make you eat it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6990</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Everyone tells me that.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6991</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Did I offend you?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6992</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My pardonsâ€¦ but you are scum, Bronn, make no mistake.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6993</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Duty, honor, friendship, what&apos;s that to you?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6994</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No, don&apos;t trouble yourself, we both know the answer.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6995</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Still, you&apos;re not stupid.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6996</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Once we reached the Vale, Lady Stark had no more need of youâ€¦ but I did, and the one thing the Lannisters have never lacked for is gold.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6997</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>When the moment came to toss the dice, I was counting on your being smart enough to know where your best interest lay.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6998</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Happily for me, you did.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6999</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Here,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7000</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ll do it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7001</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well done,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7002</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Scum you may be, but you&apos;re undeniably useful, and with a sword in your hand you&apos;re almost as good as my brother Jaime.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7003</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What do you want, Bronn?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7004</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Gold?</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>Women?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7007</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Keep me alive, and you&apos;ll have it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7008</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And if you die?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7009</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why then, I&apos;ll have one mourner whose grief is sincere,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7010</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The gold ends when I do.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7011</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Fair enough,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7012</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My sword&apos;s yours, thenâ€¦ but don&apos;t go looking for me to bend the knee and m&apos;lord you every time you take a shit.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7013</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m no man&apos;s toady.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7014</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Nor any man&apos;s friend,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7015</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ve no doubt you&apos;d betray me as quick as you did Lady Stark, if you saw a profit in it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7016</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If the day ever comes when you&apos;re tempted to sell me out, remember this, Bronnâ€”I&apos;ll match their price, whatever it is.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7017</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I like living.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7018</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And now, do you think you could do something about finding us some supper?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7019</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Take care of the horses,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7020</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>All we lack now is some good wine to wash down our kid,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7021</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That, a woman, and another dozen swords,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7022</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It will be full dark soon,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7023</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ll take first watchâ€¦ for all the good it will do us.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7024</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It might be kinder to let them kill us in our sleep.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7025</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, I imagine they&apos;ll be here long before it comes to sleep.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7026</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You have a plan,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7027</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A hope, call it,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7028</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Another toss of the dice.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7029</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>With our lives as the stake?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7030</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What choice do we have?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7031</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ahhhh,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7032</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A bit tougher than I&apos;d like, and in want of spicing, but I&apos;ll not complain too loudly.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7033</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If I were back at the Eyrie, I&apos;d be dancing on a precipice in hopes of a boiled bean.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7034</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And yet you gave the turnkey a purse of gold,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7035</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A Lannister always pays his debts.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7036</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I kept the silver,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7037</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>but you were promised the gold, and there it is.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7038</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And remember what I said, this is only a taste.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7039</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If you ever grow tired of Lady Arryn&apos;s service, present yourself at Casterly Rock, and I&apos;ll pay you the rest of what I owe you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7040</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If we do reach the river, what will you do then?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7041</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, a whore and a featherbed and a flagon of wine, for a start.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7042</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And then to Casterly Rock or King&apos;s Landing, I think.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7043</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have some questions that want answering, concerning a certain dagger.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7044</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So you were telling it true?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7045</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It was not your knife?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7046</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do I look a liar to you?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7047</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Our friends are taking their sweet time.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7048</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If I were them, I&apos;d fear a trap,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7049</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why else would we be so open, if not to lure them in?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7050</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Then we ought to sing and send them fleeing in terror.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7051</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;re mad, dwarf,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7052</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Where&apos;s your love of music, Bronn?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7053</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If it was music you wanted, you should have gotten the singer to champion you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7054</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That would have been amusing.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7055</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I can just see him fending off Ser Vardis with his woodharp.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7056</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do you know this song?</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>She was hungrier than I would have believed.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7064</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We finished two whole chickens and part of a third, and drank a flagon of wine, talking.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7065</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I was only thirteen, and the wine went to my head, I fear.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7066</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The next thing I knew, I was sharing her bed.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7067</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If she was shy, I was shyer.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7068</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ll never know where I found the courage.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7069</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>When I broke her maidenhead, she wept, but afterward she kissed me and sang her little song, and by morning I was in love.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7070</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7071</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Absurd, isn&apos;t it?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7072</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I married her,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7073</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A Lannister of Casterly Rock wed to a crofter&apos;s daughter,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7074</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How did you manage that?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7075</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, you&apos;d be astonished at what a boy can make of a few lies, fifty pieces of silver, and a drunken septon.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7076</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I dared not bring my bride home to Casterly Rock, so I set her up in a cottage of her own, and for a fortnight we played at being man and wife.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7077</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And then the septon sobered and confessed all to my lord father.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7078</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That was the end of my marriage.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7079</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He sent the girl away?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7080</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He did better than that,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7081</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>After Jaime had made his confession, to drive home the lesson, Lord Tywin brought my wife in and gave her to his guards.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7082</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They paid her fair enough.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7083</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A silver for each man, how many whores command that high a price?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7084</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He sat me down in the corner of the barracks and bade me watch, and at the end she had so many silvers the coins were slipping through her fingers and rolling on the floor, sheâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7085</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Tywin had me go last,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7086</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And he gave me a gold coin to pay her, because I was a Lannister, and worth more.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7087</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Thirteen or thirty or three, I would have killed the man who did that to me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7088</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You may get that chance one day.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7089</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Remember what I told you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7090</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A Lannister always pays his debts.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7091</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I think I will try and sleep.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7092</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Wake me if we&apos;re about to die.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7093</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Tyrion.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7094</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Come share our fire, the night is cold,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7095</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I fear we&apos;ve no wine to offer you, but you&apos;re welcome to some of our goat.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7096</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Our mountain,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7097</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Our goat.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7098</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your goat,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7099</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Who are you?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7100</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>When you meet your gods,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7101</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>say it was Gunthor son of Gurn of the Stone Crows who sent you to them.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7102</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And Shagga son of Dolf.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7103</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I am Tyrion son of Tywin, of the Clan Lannister, the Lions of the Rock.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7104</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We will gladly pay you for the goat we ate.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7105</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What do you have to give us, Tyrion son of Tywin?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7106</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There is silver in my purse,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7107</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This hauberk I wear is large for me, but it should fit Conn nicely, and the battle-axe I carry would suit Shagga&apos;s mighty hand far better than that wood-axe he holds.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7108</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The halfman would pay us with our own coin,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7109</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Conn speaks truly,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7110</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your silver is ours.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7111</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your horses are ours.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7112</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your hauberk and your battle-axe and the knife at your belt, those are ours too.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7113</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You have nothing to give us but your lives.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7114</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How would you like to die, Tyrion son of Tywin?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7115</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>In my own bed, with a belly full of wine and a maiden&apos;s mouth around my cock, at the age of eighty,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7116</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Conn, take their horses,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7117</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Kill the other and seize the halfinan.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7118</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He can milk the goats and make the mothers laugh.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7119</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Who dies first?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7120</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7121</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Gunthor son of Gurn, hear me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7122</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My House is rich and powerful.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7123</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If the Stone Crows will see us safely through these mountains, my lord father will shower you with gold.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7124</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The gold of a lowland lord is as worthless as a halfman&apos;s promises,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7125</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Half a man I may be,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7126</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>yet I have the courage to face my enemies.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7127</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What do the Stone Crows do, but hide behind rocks and shiver with fear as the knights of the Vale ride by?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7128</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Are these the best weapons you could steal?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7129</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Good enough for killing sheep, perhapsâ€¦ if the sheep do not fight back.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7130</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My father&apos;s smiths shit better steel.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7131</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Little boyman,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7132</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>will you mock my axe after I chop off your manhood and feed it to the goats?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7133</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7134</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I would hear his words.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7135</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The mothers go hungry, and steel fills more mouths than gold.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7136</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What would you give us for your lives, Tyrion son of Tywin?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7137</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Swords?</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>All that, and more, Gunthor son of Gurn,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7141</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I will give you the Vale of Arryn.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7142</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You are quite certain these were more than brigands?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7143</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Brigands, Lord Varys?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7144</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, they were brigands, beyond a doubt.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7145</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lannister brigands.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7146</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This is all the remains of the holdfast of Sherrer, Lord Eddard.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7147</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The rest are dead, along with the people of Wendish Town and the Mummer&apos;s Ford.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7148</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Rise,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7149</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>All of you, up.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7150</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Joss,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7151</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Tell the Hand what happened at Sherrer.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7152</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If it please His Graceâ€”</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7153</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>His Grace is hunting across the Blackwater,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7154</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I am Lord Eddard Stark, the King&apos;s Hand.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7155</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Tell me who you are and what you know of these raiders.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7156</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I keepâ€¦ I keptâ€¦ I kept an alehouse, m&apos;lord, in Sherrer, by the stone bridge.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7157</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The finest ale south of the Neck, everyone said so, begging your pardons, m&apos;lord.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7158</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s gone now like all the rest, m&apos;lord.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7159</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They come and drank their fill and spilled the rest before they fired my roof, and they would of spilled my blood too, if they&apos;d caught me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7160</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>M&apos;lord.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7161</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They burnt us out,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7162</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Come riding in the dark, up from the south, and fired the fields and the houses alike, killing them as tried to stop them.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7163</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They weren&apos;t no raiders, though, m&apos;lord.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7164</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They had no mind to steal our stock, not these, they butchered my milk cow where she stood and left her for the flies and the crows.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7165</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They rode down my â€™prentice boy,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7166</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Chased him back and forth across the fields on their horses, poking at him with their lances like it was a game, them laughing and the boy stumbling and screaming till the big one pierced him clean through.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7167</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They killed my mother too, Your Grace.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7168</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And theyâ€¦ theyâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7169</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>At Wendish Town, the people sought shelter in their holdfast, but the walls were timbered.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7170</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The raiders piled straw against the wood and burnt them all alive.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7171</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>When the Wendish folk opened their gates to flee the fire, they shot them down with arrows as they came running out, even women with suckling babes.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7172</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, dreadful,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7173</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How cruel can men be?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7174</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They would of done the same for us, but the Sherrer holdfast&apos;s made of stone,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7175</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Some wanted to smoke us out, but the big one said there was riper fruit upriver, and they made for the Mummer&apos;s Ford.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7176</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What proof do you have that these were Lannisters?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7177</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Did they wear crimson cloaks or fly a lion banner?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7178</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Even Lannisters are not so blind stupid as that,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7179</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Every man among them was mounted and mailed, my lord,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7180</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They were armed with steel-tipped lances and longswords, with battle-axes for the butchering.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7181</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7182</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes, you, no one&apos;s going to hurt you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7183</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Tell the Hand what you told me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7184</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Concerning their horses,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7185</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>it were warhorses they rode.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7186</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Many a year I worked in old Ser Willum&apos;s stables, so I knows the difference.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7187</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Not a one of these ever pulled a plow, gods bear witness if I&apos;m wrong.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7188</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well-mounted brigands,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7189</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Perhaps they stole the horses from the last place they raided.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7190</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How many men were there in this raiding party?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7191</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A hundred, at the least,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7192</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Fifty,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7193</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Hunnerds and hunnerds, m&apos;lord, an army they was.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7194</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You are more right than you know, goodwoman,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7195</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You say they flew no banners.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7196</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What of the armor they wore?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7197</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Did any of you note ornaments or decorations, devices on shield or helm?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7198</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It grieves me, m&apos;lord, but no, the armor they showed us was plain, onlyâ€¦ the one who led them, he was armored like the rest, but there was no mistaking him all the same.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7199</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It was the size of him, m&apos;lord.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7200</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Those as say the giants are all dead never saw this one, I swear.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7201</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Big as an ox he was, and a voice like stone breaking.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>7202</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Mountain!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7203</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Can any man doubt it?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7204</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This was Gregor Clegane&apos;s work.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7205</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ser Marq, with respect, you cannot know that this outlaw was Ser Gregor.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>There are many large men in the realm.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>As large as the Mountain That Rides?</quotetext>

		<quotetext>I have never met one.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Nor has any man here,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>My lords, open your eyes.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>Do you need to see his seal on the corpses?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7213</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It was Gregor.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7214</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why should Ser Gregor turn brigand?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>By the grace of his liege lord, he holds a stout keep and lands of his own.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>The man is an anointed knight.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>7221</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Thank you, Grand Maester Pycelle,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7222</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I fear we might have forgotten that if you had not pointed it out.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7223</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ser Marq, Ser Karyl, Ser Raymunâ€”perhaps I might ask you a question?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7224</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>These holdfasts were under your protection.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7225</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Where were you when all this slaughtering and burning was going on?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7226</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I was attending my lord father in the pass below the Golden Tooth, as was Ser Marq.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7227</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>When the word of these outrages reached Ser Edmure Tully, he sent word that we should take a small force of men to find what survivors we could and bring them to the king.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7228</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ser Edmure had summoned me to Riverrun with all my strength.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7229</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I was camped across the river from his walls, awaiting his commands, when the word reached me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7230</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>By the time I could return to my own lands, Clegane and his vermin were back across the Red Fork, riding for Lannister&apos;s hills.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7231</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And if they come again, ser?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7232</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If they come again, we&apos;ll use their blood to water the fields they burnt,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7233</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ser Edmure has sent men to every village and holdfast within a day&apos;s ride of the border,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7234</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The next raider will not have such an easy time of it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7235</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If your fields and holdfasts are safe from harm,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7236</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>what then do you ask of the throne?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7237</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The lords of the Trident keep the king&apos;s peace,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7238</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Lannisters have broken it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7239</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We ask leave to answer them, steel for steel.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7240</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We ask justice for the smallfolk of Sherrer and Wendish Town and the Mummer&apos;s Ford.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7241</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Edmure agrees, we must pay Gregor Clegane back his bloody coin,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7242</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>but old Lord Hoster commanded us to come here and beg the king&apos;s leave before we strike.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7243</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My lord Hand, if these good folk believe that Ser Gregor has forsaken his holy vows for plunder and rape, let them go to his liege lord and make their complaint.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7244</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>These crimes are no concern of the throne.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7245</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Let them seek Lord Tywin&apos;s justice.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7246</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It is all the king&apos;s justice,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7247</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>North, south, east, or west, all we do we do in Robert&apos;s name.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7248</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The king&apos;s justice,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7249</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So it is, and so we should defer this matter until the kingâ€”</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7250</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The king is hunting across the river and may not return for days,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7251</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Robert bid me to sit here in his place, to listen with his ears, and to speak with his voice.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7252</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I mean to do just thatâ€¦ though I agree that he must be told.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7253</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ser Robar.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7254</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My lord.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7255</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your father is hunting with the king,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7256</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Will you bring them word of what was said and done here today?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7257</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>At once, my lord.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7258</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do we have your leave to take our vengeance against Ser Gregor, then?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7259</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Vengeance?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7260</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I thought we were speaking of justice.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7261</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Burning Clegane&apos;s fields and slaughtering his people will not restore the king&apos;s peace, only your injured pride.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7262</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>People of Sherrer, I cannot give you back your homes or your crops, nor can I restore your dead to life.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7263</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But perhaps I can give you some small measure of justice, in the name of our king, Robert.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7264</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The First Men believed that the judge who called for death should wield the sword, and in the north we hold to that still.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7265</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I mislike sending another to do my killingâ€¦ yet it seems I have no choice.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7266</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Eddard!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7267</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I beg you the honor of acting in your place.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7268</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Give this task to me, my lord, and I swear I shall not fail you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7269</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ser Loras, if we send you off alone, Ser Gregor will send us back your head with a plum stuffed in that pretty mouth of yours.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7270</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Mountain is not the sort to bend his neck to any man&apos;s justice.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7271</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I do not fear Gregor Clegane,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7272</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Beric,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7273</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Thoros of Myr.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7274</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ser Gladden.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7275</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Lothar.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7276</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Each of you is to assemble twenty men, to bring my word to Gregor&apos;s keep.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7277</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Twenty of my own guards shall go with you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7278</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Beric Dondarrion, you shall have the command, as befits your rank.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7279</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>As you command, Lord Eddard.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7280</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, the First of his Name, King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, by the word of Eddard of the House Stark, his Hand, I charge you to ride to the westlands with all haste, to cross the Red Fork of the Trident under the king&apos;s flag, and there bring the king&apos;s justice to the false knight Gregor Clegane, and to all those who shared in his crimes.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7281</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I denounce him, and attaint him, and strip him of all rank and titles, of all lands and incomes and holdings, and do sentence him to death.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7282</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>May the gods take pity on his soul.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7283</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Eddard, what of me?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7284</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No one doubts your valor, Ser Loras, but we are about justice here, and what you seek is vengeance.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7285</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ride at first light.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7286</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>These things are best done quickly.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7287</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The throne will hear no more petitions today.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7288</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You are a bolder man than I, my lord,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7289</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How so, Lord Varys?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7290</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Had it been me up there, I should have sent Ser Loras.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7291</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He so wanted to goâ€¦ and a man who has the Lannisters for his enemies would do well to make the Tyrells his friends.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7292</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ser Loras is young,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7293</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I daresay he will outgrow the disappointment.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7294</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And Ser Ilyn?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7295</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He is the King&apos;s Justice, after all.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7296</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Sending other men to do his officeâ€¦ some might construe that as a grave insult.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7297</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No slight was intended.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7298</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I remind you, the Paynes are bannermen to House Lannister.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7299</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I thought it best to choose men who owed Lord Tywin no fealty.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7300</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Very prudent, no doubt,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7301</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Still, I chanced to see Ser Ilyn in the back of the hall, staring at us with those pale eyes of his, and I must say, he did not look pleased, though to be sure it is hard to tell with our silent knight.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7302</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I hope he outgrows his disappointment as well.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7303</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He does so love his workâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7304</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He wouldn&apos;t send Ser Loras,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7305</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I think it was because of his leg.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7306</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>His leg?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7307</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Did Ser Loras hurt his leg?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7308</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Not his leg,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7309</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Father&apos;s leg, silly.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7310</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It hurts him ever so much, it makes him cross.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7311</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Otherwise I&apos;m certain he would have sent Ser Loras.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7312</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, I don&apos;t know, Septa.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7313</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Some of her lord father&apos;s decisions could do with a bit of questioning.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7314</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The young lady is as wise as she is lovely.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7315</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The girl was just talking, my lord,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7316</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Foolish chatter.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7317</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She meant nothing by the comment.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7318</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Nothing?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7319</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Tell me, child, why would you have sent Ser Loras?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7320</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well, those are not the reasons I&apos;d have given, butâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7321</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Life is not a song, sweetling.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7322</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You may learn that one day to your sorrow.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7323</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ser Ilyn&apos;s the King&apos;s Justice, not Ser Loras,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7324</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Eddard should have sent him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7325</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ser Ilyn&apos;s almost like a second monster.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7326</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m glad Father didn&apos;t pick him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7327</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Beric is as much a hero as Ser Loras.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7328</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He&apos;s ever so brave and gallant.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7329</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I suppose,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7330</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I had a dream that Joffrey would be the one to take the white hart,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7331</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A dream?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7332</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Truly?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7333</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Did Prince Joffrey just go up to it and touch it with his bare hand and do it no harm?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7334</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7335</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He shot it with a golden arrow and brought it back for me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7336</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I saw your sister this afternoon,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7337</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She was walking through the stables on her hands.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7338</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why would she do a thing like that?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7339</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m sure I don&apos;t know why Arya does anything.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7340</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do you want to hear about the court or not?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7341</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I do,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7342</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There was a black brother,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7343</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>begging men for the Wall, only he was kind of old and smelly.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7344</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Father asked if there were any knights in the hall who would do honor to their houses by taking the black, but no one came forward, so he gave this Yoren his pick of the king&apos;s dungeons and sent him on his way.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7345</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And later these two brothers came before him, freeriders from the Dornish Marches, and pledged their swords to the service of the king.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7346</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Father accepted their oathsâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7347</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Are there any lemon cakes?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7348</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Let&apos;s see,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7349</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Where is everyone?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7350</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Did Father send them to hunt down Jaime Lannister?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7351</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They rode with Lord Beric, to behead Ser Gregor Clegane.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7352</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Septa, will Lord Beric spike Ser Gregor&apos;s head on his own gate or bring it back here for the king?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7353</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A lady does not discuss such things over her porridge.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7354</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Where are your courtesies, Sansa?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7355</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I swear, of late you&apos;ve been near as bad as your sister.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7356</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What did Gregor do?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7357</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He burned down a holdfast and murdered a lot of people, women and children too.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7358</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Jaime Lannister murdered Jory and Heward and Wyl, and the Hound murdered Mycah.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7359</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Somebody should have beheaded them.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7360</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s not the same,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7361</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Hound is Joffrey&apos;s sworn shield.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7362</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your butcher&apos;s boy attacked the prince.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7363</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Liar,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7364</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Go ahead, call me all the names you want,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7365</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You won&apos;t dare when I&apos;m married to Joffrey.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7366</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;ll have to bow to me and call me Your Grace.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7367</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You have juice on your face, Your Grace,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7368</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;re horrible,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7369</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They should have killed you instead of Lady!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7370</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your lord father will hear of this!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7371</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Go to your chambers, at once.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7372</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>At once!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7373</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Me too?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7374</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That&apos;s not fair.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>Sansa.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7382</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do you hear me?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7383</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes, Septa,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7384</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Might I have a moment to dress, please?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>Come here, Sansa,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7386</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Sit beside me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7387</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Here is the other one,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7388</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My thanks, Septa Mordane.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7389</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I would talk to my daughters alone, if you would be so kind.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7390</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Arya started it,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7391</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She called me a liar and threw an orange at me and spoiled my dress, the ivory silk, the one Queen Cersei gave me when I was betrothed to Prince Joffrey.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7392</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She hates that I&apos;m going to marry the prince.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7393</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She tries to spoil everything, Father, she can&apos;t stand for anything to be beautiful or nice or splendid.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7394</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Enough, Sansa.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7395</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m sorry, Father.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7396</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I was wrong and I beg my sweet sister&apos;s forgiveness.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7397</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What about my dress?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7398</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Maybeâ€¦ I could wash it,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7399</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Washing won&apos;t do any good,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7400</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Not if you scrubbed all day and all night.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7401</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The silk is ruined.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7402</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Then I&apos;llâ€¦ make you a new one,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7403</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7404</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You couldn&apos;t sew a dress fit to clean the pigsties.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7405</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I did not call you here to talk of dresses.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7406</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m sending you both back to Winterfell.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7407</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You can&apos;t,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7408</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Please, Father,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7409</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Please don&apos;t.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7410</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>At last we&apos;ve found something you agree on.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7411</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I didn&apos;t do anything wrong,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7412</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I don&apos;t want to go back.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7413</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Send Arya away, she started it, Father, I swear it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7414</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ll be good, you&apos;ll see, just let me stay and I promise to be as fine and noble and courteous as the queen.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7415</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Sansa, I&apos;m not sending you away for fighting, though the gods know I&apos;m sick of you two squabbling.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7416</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I want you back in Winterfell for your own safety.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7417</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Three of my men were cut down like dogs not a league from where we sit, and what does Robert do?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7418</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He goes hunting.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7419</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Can we take Syrio back with us?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7420</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Who cares about your stupid dancing master?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7421</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Father, I only just now remembered, I can&apos;t go away, I&apos;m to marry Prince Joffrey.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7422</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I love him, Father, I truly truly do, I love him as much as Queen Naerys loved Prince Aemon the Dragonknight, as much as Jonquil loved Ser Florian.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7423</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I want to be his queen and have his babies.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7424</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Sweet one,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7425</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>listen to me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7426</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>When you&apos;re old enough, I will make you a match with a high lord who&apos;s worthy of you, someone brave and gentle and strong.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7427</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This match with Joffrey was a terrible mistake.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7428</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That boy is no Prince Aemon, you must believe me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7429</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He is!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7430</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I don&apos;t want someone brave and gentle, I want him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7431</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We&apos;ll be ever so happy, just like in the songs, you&apos;ll see.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7432</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ll give him a son with golden hair, and one day he&apos;ll be the king of all the realm, the greatest king that ever was, as brave as the wolf and as proud as the lion.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7433</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Not if Joffrey&apos;s his father,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7434</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He&apos;s a liar and a craven and anyhow he&apos;s a stag, not a lion.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7435</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He is not!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7436</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He&apos;s not the least bit like that old drunken king,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7437</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Gods,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7438</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>out of the mouth of babesâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7439</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I am looking for a fast trading galley to take you home.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7440</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>These days, the sea is safer than the kingsroad.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7441</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You will sail as soon as I can find a proper ship, with Septa Mordane and a complement of guardsâ€¦ and yes, with Syrio Forel, if he agrees to enter my service.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7442</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But say nothing of this.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7443</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s better if no one knows of our plans.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7444</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We&apos;ll talk again tomorrow.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7445</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Stop that weeping, child,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7446</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I am certain your lord father knows what is best for you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7447</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It won&apos;t be so bad, Sansa,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7448</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We&apos;re going to sail on a galley.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7449</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It will be an adventure, and then we&apos;ll be with Bran and Robb again, and Old Nan and Hodor and the rest.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7450</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Hodor!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7451</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You ought to marry Hodor, you&apos;re just like him, stupid and hairy and ugly!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7452</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Pain is a gift from the gods, Lord Eddard,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7453</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It means the bone is knitting, the flesh healing itself.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7454</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Be thankful.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7455</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I will be thankful when my leg stops throbbing.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7456</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The milk of the poppy, for when the pain grows too onerous.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7457</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I sleep too much already.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7458</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Sleep is the great healer.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7459</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I had hoped that was you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7460</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It is good to see you in such a fierce humor, my lord.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7461</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There was a raven this morning, a letter for the queen from her lord father.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7462</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I thought you had best know.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7463</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Dark wings, dark words,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7464</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What of it?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7465</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Tywin is greatly wroth about the men you sent after Ser Gregor Clegane,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7466</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I feared he would be.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7467</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You will recall, I said as much in council.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7468</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Let him be wroth,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7469</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Let him write all the letters to the queen he likes.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7470</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Beric rides beneath the king&apos;s own banner.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7471</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If Lord Tywin attempts to interfere with the king&apos;s justice, he will have Robert to answer to.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7472</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The only thing His Grace enjoys more than hunting is making war on lords who defy him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7473</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>As you say.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7474</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I shall visit again on the morrow.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7475</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I cannot visit long, my lord,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7476</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lady Tanda expects me to lunch with her.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7477</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No doubt she will roast me a fatted calf.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7478</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If it&apos;s near as fatted as her daughter, I&apos;m like to rupture and die.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7479</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And how is your leg?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7480</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Inflamed and painful, with an itch that is driving me mad.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7481</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>In future, try not to let any horses fall on it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7482</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I would urge you to heal quickly.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7483</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The realm grows restive.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7484</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Varys has heard ominous whispers from the west.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7485</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Freeriders and sellswords have been flocking to Casterly Rock, and not for the thin pleasure of Lord Tywin&apos;s conversation.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7486</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Is there word of the king?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7487</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Just how long does Robert intend to hunt?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7488</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Given his preferences, I believe he&apos;d stay in the forest until you and the queen both die of old age,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7489</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lacking that, I imagine he&apos;ll return as soon as he&apos;s killed something.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7490</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They found the white hart, it seemsâ€¦ or rather, what remained of it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7491</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Some wolves found it first, and left His Grace scarcely more than a hoof and a horn.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7492</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Robert was in a fury, until he heard talk of some monstrous boar deeper in the forest.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7493</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Then nothing would do but he must have it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7494</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Prince Joffrey returned this morning, with the Royces, Ser Balon Swann, and some twenty others of the party.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7495</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The rest are still with the king.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7496</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Hound?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7497</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, returned with Joffrey, and went straight to the queen.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7498</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I would have given a hundred silver stags to have been a roach in the rushes when he learned that Lord Beric was off to behead his brother.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7499</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Even a blind man could see the Hound loathed his brother.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7500</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ah, but Gregor was his to loathe, not yours to kill.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7501</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Once Dondarrion lops the summit off our Mountain, the Clegane lands and incomes will pass to Sandor, but I wouldn&apos;t hold my water waiting for his thanks, not that one.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7502</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And now you must forgive me.</quotetext>
	</quote>

	</quote>

		<quotetext>The thunder of his hooves!</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Wine?</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>7662</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Wine,</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>7663</quoteindex>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7664</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Is that wise?</quotetext>

		<quotetext>What if he&apos;s betrayed?</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Jhogo told me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7673</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Some of the traders have eunuchs with them, huge men who strangle thieves with wisps of silk.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7674</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That way no blood is shed and the gods are not angered.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Then let us hope your brother will be wise enough not to steal anything.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7676</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He had planned to take your dragon&apos;s eggs, until I warned him that I&apos;d cut off his hand if he so much as touched them.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7677</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My eggsâ€¦ but they&apos;re mine, Magister Illyrio gave them to me, a bride gift, why would Viserys wantâ€¦ they&apos;re only stonesâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7678</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The same could be said of rubies and diamonds and fire opals, Princessâ€¦ and dragon&apos;s eggs are rarer by far.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7679</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Those traders he&apos;s been drinking with would sell their own manhoods for even one of those stones, and with all three Viserys could buy as many sellswords as he might need.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7680</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Thenâ€¦ he should have them.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7681</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He does not need to steal them.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7682</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He had only to ask.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>He is my brotherâ€¦ and my true king.</quotetext>
	</quote>

	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7697</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Everyone was shouting it at me, but I don&apos;t understand.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>Now give me something for the pain and let me die.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7871</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Will I dream?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7872</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You will, my lord.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7873</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Good,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7874</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I will give Lyanna your love, Ned.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7875</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Take care of my children for me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7876</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I shallâ€¦ guard your children as if they were my own,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7877</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I will do all in my power, my lord, but the wound has mortified.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7878</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It took them two days to get him back.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7879</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>By the time I saw him, it was too late.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7880</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I can lessen His Grace&apos;s suffering, but only the gods can heal him now.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7881</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How long?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7882</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>By rights, he should be dead already.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7883</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have never seen a man cling to life so fiercely.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7884</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My brother was always strong,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7885</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Not wise, perhaps, but strong.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7886</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He slew the boar.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7887</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>His entrails were sliding from his belly, yet somehow he slew the boar.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7888</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Robert was never a man to leave the battleground so long as a foe remained standing,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7889</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Maester Pycelle has given Robert the milk of the poppy,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7890</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>See that no one disturbs his rest without leave from me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7891</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It shall be as you command, my lord.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7892</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have failed my sacred trust.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7893</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Even the truest knight cannot protect a king against himself,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7894</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Robert loved to hunt boar.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7895</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have seen him take a thousand of them.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7896</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No one could know this one would be his death.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7897</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You are kind to say so, Lord Eddard.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7898</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The king himself said as much.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7899</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He blamed the wine.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7900</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>His Grace was reeling in his saddle by the time we flushed the boar from his lair, yet he commanded us all to stand aside.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7901</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I wonder, Ser Barristan,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7902</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>who gave the king this wine?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7903</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The wine was from the king&apos;s own skin,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7904</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Only one skin?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7905</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Hunting is such thirsty work.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7906</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I did not keep count.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7907</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>More than one, for a certainty.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7908</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>His squire would fetch him a fresh skin whenever he required it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7909</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Such a dutiful boy,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7910</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>to make certain His Grace did not lack for refreshment.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7911</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Which squire?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7912</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The elder,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7913</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lancel.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7914</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I know the lad well,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7915</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A stalwart boy, Ser Kevan Lannister&apos;s son, nephew to Lord Tywin and cousin to the queen.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7916</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I hope the dear sweet lad does not blame himself.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7917</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Children are so vulnerable in the innocence of their youth, how well do I remember.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7918</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You mention children.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7919</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Robert had a change of heart concerning Daenerys Targaryen.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7920</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Whatever arrangements you made, I want unmade.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7921</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>At once.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7922</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Alas,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7923</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>At once may be too late.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>I fear those birds have flown.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7925</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But I shall do what I can, my lord.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7926</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>With your leave.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7927</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Eddard,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7928</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>a moment, if you would be so kind.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7929</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>As you wish.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7930</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Send your men away.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7931</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That letter.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7932</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Was it the regency?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7933</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Has my brother named you Protector?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7934</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My lord, I have thirty men in my personal guard, and other friends beside, knights and lords.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7935</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Give me an hour, and I can put a hundred swords in your hand.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7936</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And what should I do with a hundred swords, my lord?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7937</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Strike!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7938</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Now, while the castle sleeps.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7939</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We must get Joffrey away from his mother and take him in hand.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7940</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Protector or no, the man who holds the king holds the kingdom.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7941</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We should seize Myrcella and Tommen as well.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7942</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Once we have her children, Cersei will not dare oppose us.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7943</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The council will confirm you as Lord Protector and make Joffrey your ward.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7944</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Robert is not dead yet.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7945</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The gods may spare him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7946</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If not, I shall convene the council to hear his final words and consider the matter of the succession, but I will not dishonor his last hours on earth by shedding blood in his halls and dragging frightened children from their beds.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7947</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Every moment you delay gives Cersei another moment to prepare.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7948</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>By the time Robert dies, it may be too lateâ€¦ for both of us.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7949</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Then we should pray that Robert does not die.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7950</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Small chance of that,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7951</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Sometimes the gods are merciful.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7952</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Lannisters are not.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7953</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I want Littlefinger,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7954</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If he&apos;s not in his chambers, take as many men as you need and search every winesink and whorehouse in King&apos;s Landing until you find him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7955</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Bring him to me before break of day.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>The Wind Witch sails on the evening tide.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7957</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Have you chosen the escort?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7958</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ten men, with Porther in command.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7959</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Twenty, and you will command,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7960</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>As you wish, m&apos;lord,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7961</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Can&apos;t say I&apos;ll be sad to see the back of this place.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7962</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I miss the wife.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7963</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You will pass near Dragonstone when you turn north.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7964</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I need you to deliver a letter for me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7965</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>To Dragonstone, m&apos;lord?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7966</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Tell Captain Qos to hoist my banner as soon as he comes in sight of the island.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7967</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They may be wary of unexpected visitors.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7968</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If he is reluctant, offer him whatever it takes.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7969</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I will give you a letter to place into the hand of Lord Stannis Baratheon.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7970</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No one else.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7971</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Not his steward, nor the captain of his guard, nor his lady wife, but only Lord Stannis himself.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7972</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>As you command, m&apos;lord.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7973</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I suppose congratulations are in order,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7974</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The king lies wounded and near to death.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7975</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I know,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7976</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I also know that Robert has named you Protector of the Realm.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7977</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And how is it you know that, my lord?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7978</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Varys hinted as much,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7979</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>and you have just confirmed it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7980</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Damn Varys and his little birds.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7981</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Catelyn spoke truly, the man has some black art.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7982</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I do not trust him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7983</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Excellent.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7984</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;re learning.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7985</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yet I&apos;ll wager you did not drag me here in the black of night to discuss the eunuch.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7986</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7987</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I know the secret Jon Arryn was murdered to protect.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7988</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Robert will leave no trueborn son behind him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7989</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Joffrey and Tommen are Jaime Lannister&apos;s bastards, born of his incestuous union with the queen.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7990</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Shocking,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7991</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The girl as well?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7992</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No doubt.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7993</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So when the king diesâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7994</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The throne by rights passes to Lord Stannis, the elder of Robert&apos;s two brothers.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7995</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So it would seem.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7996</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Unlessâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7997</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Unless, my lord?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7998</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There is no seeming to this.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7999</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Stannis is the heir.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8000</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Nothing can change that.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8001</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Stannis cannot take the throne without your help.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8002</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If you&apos;re wise, you&apos;ll make certain Joffrey succeeds.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8003</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Have you no shred of honor?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8004</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, a shred, surely,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8005</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Now look at the other side of the coin.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8006</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Joffrey is but twelve, and Robert gave you the regency, my lord.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8007</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You are the Hand of the King and Protector of the Realm.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8008</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The power is yours, Lord Stark.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8009</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>All you need do is reach out and take it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8010</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Make your peace with the Lannisters.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8011</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Release the Imp.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8012</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Wed Joffrey to your Sansa.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8013</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Wed your younger girl to Prince Tommen, and your heir to Myrcella.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8014</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It will be four years before Joffrey comes of age.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8015</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>By then he will look to you as a second father, and if not, wellâ€¦ four years is a good long while, my lord.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8016</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Long enough to dispose of Lord Stannis.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8017</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Then, should Joffrey prove troublesome, we can reveal his little secret and put Lord Renly on the throne.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8018</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8019</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;ll need someone to share your burdens.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8020</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I assure you, my price would be modest.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8021</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your price.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8022</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Baelish, what you suggest is treason.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8023</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Only if we lose.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8024</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You forget,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8025</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You forget Jon Arryn.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8026</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You forget Jory Cassel.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8027</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And you forget this.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8028</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They sent a man to cut my son&apos;s throat, Lord Baelish.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8029</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I fear I did forget, my lord.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8030</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Pray forgive me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8031</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>For a moment I did not remember that I was talking to a Stark.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8032</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So it will be Stannis, and war?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8033</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It is not a choice.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8034</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Stannis is the heir.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8035</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Far be it from me to dispute the Lord Protector.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8036</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What would you have of me, then?</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Not my wisdom, for a certainty.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8038</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I shall do my best to forget yourâ€¦ wisdom,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8039</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I called you here to ask for the help you promised Catelyn.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>This is a perilous hour for all of us.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8041</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Robert has named me Protector, true enough, but in the eyes of the world, Joffrey is still his son and heir.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8042</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The queen has a dozen knights and a hundred men-at-arms who will do whatever she commandsâ€¦ enough to overwhelm what remains of my own household guard.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8043</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And for all I know, her brother Jaime may be riding for King&apos;s Landing even as we speak, with a Lannister host at his back.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8044</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And you without an army.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8045</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There is small love lost between Lord Renly and the Lannisters.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8046</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Bronze Yohn Royce, Ser Balon Swann, Ser Loras, Lady Tanda, the Redwyne twinsâ€¦ each of them has a retinue of knights and sworn swords here at court.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8047</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Renly has thirty men in his personal guard, the rest even fewer.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8048</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It is not enough, even if I could be certain that all of them will choose to give me their allegiance.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8049</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I must have the gold cloaks.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8050</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The City Watch is two thousand strong, sworn to defend the castle, the city, and the king&apos;s peace.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8051</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ah, but when the queen proclaims one king and the Hand another, whose peace do they protect?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8052</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why, there&apos;s your answer,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8053</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They follow the man who pays them.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8054</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You wear your honor like a suit of armor, Stark.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8055</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You think it keeps you safe, but all it does is weigh you down and make it hard for you to move.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8056</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Look at you now.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8057</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You know why you summoned me here.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8058</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You know what you want to ask me to do.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8059</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You know it has to be doneâ€¦ but it&apos;s not honorable, so the words stick in your throat.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8060</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I ought to make you say it, but that would be cruelâ€¦ so have no fear, my good lord.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8061</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>For the sake of the love I bear for Catelyn, I will go to Janos Slynt this very hour and make certain that the City Watch is yours.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8062</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Six thousand gold pieces should do it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8063</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A third for the Commander, a third for the officers, a third for the men.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8064</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We might be able to buy them for half that much, but I prefer not to take chances.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8065</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ve been summoned to the sept,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8066</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They&apos;re passing me out of training.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8067</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m to be made a brother with the rest of you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8068</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Can you believe it?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8069</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No, truly?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8070</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Truly.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8071</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m to assist Maester Aemon with the library and the birds.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8072</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He needs someone who can read and write letters.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8073</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;ll do well at that,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8074</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Is it time to go?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8075</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I shouldn&apos;t be late, they might change their minds.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8076</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You came to us outlaws,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8077</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You have learned the words of the vow.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8078</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Think carefully before you say them, for once you have taken the black, there is no turning back.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8079</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The penalty for desertion is death.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8080</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Are there any among you who wish to leave our company?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8081</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If so, go now, and no one shall think the less of you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8082</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well and good,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8083</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You may take your vows here at evenfall, before Septon Celladar and the first of your order.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8084</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do any of you keep to the old gods?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8085</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I do, my lord.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8086</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I expect you will want to say your words before a heart tree, as your uncle did,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8087</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes, my lord,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8088</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There&apos;s no godswood here.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8089</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Is there?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8090</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I never saw a godswood.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8091</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You wouldn&apos;t see a herd of aurochs until they trampled you into the snow,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8092</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I would so,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8093</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;d see them a long way off.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8094</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Castle Black has no need of a godswood.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8095</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Beyond the Wall the haunted forest stands as it stood in the Dawn Age, long before the Andals brought the Seven across the narrow sea.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8096</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You will find a grove of weirwoods half a league from this spot, and mayhap your gods as well.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8097</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My lord.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8098</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Might Iâ€¦ might I go as well?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8099</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>To say my words at this heart tree?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8100</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Does House Tarly keep the old gods too?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8101</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No, my lord,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8102</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I was named in the light of the Seven at the sept on Horn Hill, as my father was, and his father, and all the Tarlys for a thousand years.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8103</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why would you forsake the gods of your father and your House?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8104</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Night&apos;s Watch is my House now,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8105</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Seven have never answered my prayers.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8106</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Perhaps the old gods will.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8107</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>As you wish, boy,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8108</quoteindex>

		<quoteindex>8121</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Builders,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8122</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Dareon, I am told that you sang at many a high lord&apos;s table and shared their meat and mead.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8123</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We are sending you to Eastwatch.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8124</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It may be your palate will be some help to Cotter Pyke when merchant galleys come trading.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8125</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We are paying too dear for salt beef and pickled fish, and the quality of the olive oil we&apos;re getting has been frightful, Present yourself to Borcas when you arrive, he will keep you busy between ships.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8126</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Commander Mormont has requested you for his personal steward, Jon.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8127</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;ll sleep in a cell beneath his chambers, in the Lord Commander&apos;s tower.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8128</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And what will my duties be?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8129</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Will I serve the Lord Commander&apos;s meals, help him fasten his clothes, fetch hot water for his bath?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8130</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Certainly.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8131</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And you will run his messages, keep a fire burning in his chambers, change his sheets and blankets daily, and do all else that the Lord Commander might require of you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8132</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do you take me for a servant?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8133</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8134</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We took you for a man of the Night&apos;s Watchâ€¦ but perhaps we were wrong in that.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8135</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>May I go?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8136</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>As you wish,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8137</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Jon,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8138</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Wait.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8139</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Don&apos;t you see what they&apos;re doing?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8140</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I see Ser Alliser&apos;s bloody hand, that&apos;s all I see.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8141</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He wanted to shame me, and he has.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8142</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The stewards are fine for the likes of you and me, Sam, but not for Lord Snow.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8143</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m a better swordsman and a better rider than any of you,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8144</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s not fair!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8145</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Fair?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8146</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The girl was waiting for me, naked as the day she was born.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8147</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She pulled me through the window, and you talk to me of fair?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8148</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There is no shame in being a steward,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8149</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do you think I want to spend the rest of my life washing an old man&apos;s smallclothes?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8150</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The old man is Lord Commander of the Night&apos;s Watch,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8151</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>When I was little, my father used to insist that I attend him in the audience chamber whenever he held court.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8152</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>When he rode to Highgarden to bend his knee to Lord Tyrell, he made me come.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8153</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Later, though, he started to take Dickon and leave me at home, and he no longer cared whether I sat through his audiences, so long as Dickon was there.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8154</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He wanted his heir at his side, don&apos;t you see?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8155</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>To watch and listen and learn from all he did.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8156</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ll wager that&apos;s why Lord Mormont requested you, Jon.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8157</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What else could it be?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8158</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He wants to groom you for command!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8159</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I never asked for this,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8160</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>None of us are here for asking,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8161</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You have the right of it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8162</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I was acting the boy.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8163</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Then you&apos;ll stay and say your words with me?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8164</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The old gods will be expecting us.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8165</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The wildlingsâ€¦ they wouldn&apos;tâ€¦ they&apos;d never dare come this close to the Wall.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8166</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Would they?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8167</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They never have.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8168</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do you mean to take that beast?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8169</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes, my lord,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>This is a sacred place, we will not defile it.</quotetext>

	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8174</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Hear my words, and bear witness to my vow,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>Night gathers, and now my watch begins.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8176</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It shall not end until my death.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8177</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>I shall wear no crowns and win no glory.</quotetext>

	</quote>

		<quotetext>I am the sword in the darkness.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>I am the watcher on the walls.</quotetext>
	</quote>

	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8183</quoteindex>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8195</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>All my things are packed.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8196</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A short lesson, and make certain you leave yourself time to bathe and change.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8197</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I want you ready to leave by midday, is that understood?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8198</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>By midday,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8199</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If she can have a dancing lesson, why won&apos;t you let me say farewell to Prince Joffrey?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8200</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I would gladly go with her, Lord Eddard,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8201</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There would be no question of her missing the ship.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8202</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It would not be wise for you to go to Joffrey right now, Sansa.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8203</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m sorry.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8204</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But why?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8205</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Sansa, your lord father knows best,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8206</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You are not to question his decisions.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8207</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s not fair!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8208</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Let her go, Septa.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8209</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I will try to make her understand when we are all safely back in Winterfell.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>King Robert is gone.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>8212</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The gods give him rest.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8213</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8214</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He hated rest.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8215</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The gods give him love and laughter, and the joy of righteous battle.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8216</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Be so good as to summon the members of the council here to my solar,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8217</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My lord?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8218</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Surely the affairs of the kingdom will keep till the morrow, when our grief is not so fresh.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8219</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I fear we must convene at once.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8220</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>As the Hand commands.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8221</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My lords,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8222</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>my place is beside the young king now.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8223</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Pray give me leave to attend him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8224</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your place is here, Ser Barristan,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8225</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My lords,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8226</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That little task you set me is accomplished, Lord Eddard.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8227</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The little birds sing a grievous song today,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8228</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The realm weeps.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8229</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Shall we begin?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8230</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>When Lord Renly arrives,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8231</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I fear Lord Renly has left the city.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8232</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Left the city?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8233</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He took his leave through a postern gate an hour before dawn, accompanied by Ser Loras Tyrell and some fifty retainers,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8234</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>When last seen, they were galloping south in some haste, no doubt bound for Storm&apos;s End or Highgarden.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8235</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The king called me to his side last night and commanded me to record his final words.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8236</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Renly and Grand Maester Pycelle stood witness as Robert sealed the letter, to be opened by the council after his death.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8237</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ser Barristan, if you would be so kind?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8238</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>King Robert&apos;s seal, and unbroken.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8239</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Eddard Stark is herein named Protector of the Realm, to rule as regent until the heir comes of age.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8240</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I would ask this council to confirm me as Lord Protector, as Robert wished,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8241</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Pardon, my lords, the king&apos;s steward insistsâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8242</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Esteemed lords, the king demands the immediate presence of his small council in the throne room.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8243</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The king is dead,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8244</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>but we shall go with you nonetheless.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8245</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Tom, assemble an escort, if you would.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8246</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>All hail His Grace, Joffrey of the Houses Baratheon and Lannister, the First of his Name, King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8247</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I command the council to make all the necessary arrangements for my coronation,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8248</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I wish to be crowned within the fortnight.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8249</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Today I shall accept oaths of fealty from my loyal councillors.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8250</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Varys, be so kind as to show this to my lady of Lannister.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8251</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Protector of the Realm,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8252</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Is this meant to be your shield, my lord?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8253</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A piece of paper?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8254</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Those were the king&apos;s words,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8255</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We have a new king now,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8256</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Eddard, when last we spoke, you gave me some counsel.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8257</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Allow me to return the courtesy.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8258</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Bend the knee, my lord.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8259</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Bend the knee and swear fealty to my son, and we shall allow you to step down as Hand and live out your days in the grey waste you call home.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8260</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Would that I could,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8261</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your son has no claim to the throne he sits.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8262</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Stannis is Robert&apos;s true heir.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8263</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Liar!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8264</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Mother, what does he mean?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8265</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Isn&apos;t Joff the king now?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8266</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You condemn yourself with your own mouth, Lord Stark,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8267</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ser Barristan, seize this traitor.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8268</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And now the treason moves from words to deeds,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8269</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do you think Ser Barristan stands alone, my lord?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8270</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Kill him!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8271</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Kill all of them, I command it!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8272</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You leave me no choice,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8273</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Commander, take the queen and her children into custody.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8274</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do them no harm, but escort them back to the royal apartments and keep them there, under guard.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8275</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Men of the Watch!</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>I want no bloodshed,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>I did warn you not to trust me, you know.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8297</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You are dead now.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8298</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You cheated,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8299</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You said left and you went right.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8300</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Just so.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8301</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And now you are a dead girl.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8302</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But you lied!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8303</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My words lied.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8304</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My eyes and my arm shouted out the truth, but you were not seeing.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8305</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I was so,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8306</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I watched you every second!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8307</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Watching is not seeing, dead girl.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8308</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The water dancer sees.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8309</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Come, put down the sword, it is time for listening now.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8310</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Syrio Forel was first sword to the Sealord of Braavos, and are you knowing how that came to pass?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8311</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You were the finest swordsman in the city.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8312</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Just so, but why?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8313</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Other men were stronger, faster, younger, why was Syrio Forel the best?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8314</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I will tell you now.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8315</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And to him I said, â€˜Each night in the alleys of Braavos I see a thousand like him,â€™ and the Sealord laughed, and that day I was named the first sword.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8316</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I don&apos;t understand.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8317</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The cat was an ordinary cat, no more.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8318</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The others expected a fabulous beast, so that is what they saw.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8319</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How large it was, they said.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8320</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It was no larger than any other cat, only fat from indolence, for the Sealord fed it from his own table.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8321</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What curious small ears, they said.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8322</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Its ears had been chewed away in kitten fights.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8323</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And it was plainly a tomcat, yet the Sealord said â€˜her,â€™ and that is what the others saw.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8324</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Are you hearing?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8325</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You saw what was there.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8326</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Just so.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8327</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Opening your eyes is all that is needing.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8328</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The heart lies and the head plays tricks with us, but the eyes see true.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8329</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Look with your eyes.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8330</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Hear with your ears.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8331</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Taste with your mouth.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8332</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Smell with your nose.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8333</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Feel with your skin.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8334</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Then comes the thinking, afterward, and in that way knowing the truth.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8335</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Just so,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8336</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I am thinking that when we are reaching this Winterfell of yours, it will be time to put this needle in your hand.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8337</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8338</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Wait till I show Jonâ€”</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8339</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Arya Stark,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8340</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>come with us, child.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8341</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What do you want?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8342</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your father wants to see you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8343</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And why is it that Lord Eddard is sending Lannister men in the place of his own?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8344</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I am wondering.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8345</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Mind your place, dancing master,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8346</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This is no concern of yours.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8347</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My father wouldn&apos;t send you,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8348</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Put down the stick, girl,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8349</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I am a Sworn Brother of the Kingsguard, the White Swords.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8350</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So was the Kingslayer when he killed the old king,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8351</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I don&apos;t have to go with you if I don&apos;t want.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8352</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Take her,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8353</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You will be stopping there.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8354</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Are you men or dogs that you would threaten a child?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8355</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Out of the way, old man,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8356</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I am Syrio Forel, and you will now be speaking to me with more respect.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8357</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Bald bastard.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>8358</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My hand,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>You are quick, for a dancing master,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8360</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You are slow, for a knight,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8361</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Kill the Braavosi and bring me the girl,</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>Sansa, my sweet child,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>I&apos;m sorry that I could not send for you sooner.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Matters have been very unsettled, and I have not had a moment.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>I trust my people have been taking good care of you?</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Everyone has been very sweet and pleasant, Your Grace, thank you ever so much for asking,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8422</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Only, well, no one will talk to us or tell us what&apos;s happenedâ€¦</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8423</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Us?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8424</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We put the steward&apos;s girl in with her,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8425</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We did not know what else to do with her.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8426</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Next time, you will ask,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8427</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The gods only know what sort of tales she&apos;s been filling Sansa&apos;s head with.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8428</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Jeyne&apos;s scared,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8429</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She won&apos;t stop crying.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8430</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I promised her I&apos;d ask if she could see her father.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8431</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Her father is well, isn&apos;t he?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8432</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I won&apos;t have Sansa fretting needlessly.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8433</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What shall we do with this little friend of hers, my lords?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8434</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ll find a place for her.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8435</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Not in the city,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8436</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do you take me for a fool?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8437</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ser Boros, escort this girl to Lord Petyr&apos;s apartments and instruct his people to keep her there until he comes for her.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8438</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Tell her that Littlefinger will be taking her to see her father, that ought to calm her down.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8439</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I want her gone before Sansa returns to her chamber.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>8440</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>As you command, Your Grace,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8441</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I don&apos;t understand,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8442</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Where is Jeyne&apos;s father?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8443</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why can&apos;t Ser Boros take her to him instead of Lord Petyr having to do it?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8444</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Where are you sending her?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8445</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She hasn&apos;t done anything wrong, she&apos;s a good girl.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8446</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She&apos;s upset you,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8447</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We can&apos;t be having that.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8448</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Not another word, now.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8449</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Baelish will see that Jeyne&apos;s well taken care of, I promise you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8450</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Sit down, Sansa.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8451</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I want to talk to you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8452</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Sweet Sansa,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8453</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Such a beautiful child.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8454</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I do hope you know how much Joffrey and I love you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8455</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You do?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8456</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I think of you almost as my own daughter.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8457</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And I know the love you bear for Joffrey.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8458</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I am afraid we have some grave news about your lord father.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8459</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You must be brave, child.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8460</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What is it?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8461</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your father is a traitor, dear,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8462</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>With my own ears, I heard Lord Eddard swear to our beloved King Robert that he would protect the young princes as if they were his own sons.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8463</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And yet the moment the king was dead, he called the small council together to steal Prince Joffrey&apos;s rightful throne.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8464</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8465</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He wouldn&apos;t do that.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8466</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He wouldn&apos;t!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8467</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We found this on the captain of your household guard, Sansa.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8468</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It is a letter to my late husband&apos;s brother Stannis, inviting him to take the crown.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8469</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Please, Your Grace, there&apos;s been a mistake.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8470</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Please, send for my father, he&apos;ll tell you, he would never write such a letter, the king was his friend.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8471</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Robert thought so,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8472</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This betrayal would have broken his heart.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8473</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The gods are kind, that he did not live to see it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8474</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Sansa, sweetling, you must see what a dreadful position this has left us in.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8475</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You are innocent of any wrong, we all know that, and yet you are the daughter of a traitor.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8476</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How can I allow you to marry my son?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8477</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But I love him,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8478</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How well I know that, child,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8479</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why else should you have come to me and told me of your father&apos;s plan to send you away from us, if not for love?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8480</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It was for love,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8481</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Father wouldn&apos;t even give me leave to say farewell.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8482</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He was going to take me back to Winterfell and marry me to some hedge knight, even though it was Joff I wanted.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8483</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I told him, but he wouldn&apos;t listen.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8484</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Please,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8485</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>you have to let me marry Joffrey, I&apos;ll be ever so good a wife to him, you&apos;ll see.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8486</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ll be a queen just like you, I promise.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8487</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My lords of the council, what do you say to her plea?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8488</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The poor child,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8489</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A love so true and innocent, Your Grace, it would be cruel to deny itâ€¦ and yet, what can we do?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8490</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Her father stands condemned.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8491</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A child born of traitor&apos;s seed will find that betrayal comes naturally to her,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8492</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She is a sweet thing now, but in ten years, who can say what treasons she may hatch?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8493</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8494</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m not, I&apos;d neverâ€¦ I wouldn&apos;t betray Joffrey, I love him, I swear it, I do.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8495</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, so poignant,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8496</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And yet, it is truly said that blood runs truer than oaths.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8497</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She reminds me of the mother, not the father,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8498</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Look at her.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8499</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The hair, the eyes.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8500</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She is the very image of Cat at the same age.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8501</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Child,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8502</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>if I could truly believe that you were not like your father, why nothing should please me more than to see you wed to my Joffrey.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8503</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I know he loves you with all his heart.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8504</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And yet, I fear that Lord Varys and the Grand Maester have the right of it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8505</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The blood will tell.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8506</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have only to remember how your sister set her wolf on my son.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8507</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m not like Arya,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8508</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She has the traitor&apos;s blood, not me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8509</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m good, ask Septa Mordane, she&apos;ll tell you, I only want to be Joffrey&apos;s loyal and loving wife.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8510</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I believe you mean it, child.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8511</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My lords, it seems to me that if the rest of her kin were to remain loyal in this terrible time, that would go a long way toward laying our fears to rest.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8512</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Eddard has three sons.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8513</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Mere boys,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8514</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I should be more concerned with Lady Catelyn and the Tullys.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8515</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Child, do you know your letters?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8516</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I am pleased to hear that.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8517</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Perhaps there is hope for you and Joffrey stillâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8518</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What do you want me to do?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8519</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You must write your lady mother, and your brother, the eldestâ€¦ what is his name?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8520</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Robb,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8521</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The word of your lord father&apos;s treason will no doubt reach them soon.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8522</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Better that it should come from you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8523</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You must tell them how Lord Eddard betrayed his king.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8524</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But he neverâ€¦ I don&apos;tâ€¦ Your Grace, I wouldn&apos;t know what to sayâ€¦</quotetext>

		<quotetext>The important thing is that you urge Lady Catelyn and your brother to keep the king&apos;s peace.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8527</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It will go hard for them if they don&apos;t,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8528</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>By the love you bear them, you must urge them to walk the path of wisdom.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Your lady mother will no doubt fear for you dreadfully,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8530</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You must tell her that you are well and in our care, that we are treating you gently and seeing to your every want.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Bid them to come to King&apos;s Landing and pledge their fealty to Joffrey when he takes his throne.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>8532</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If they do thatâ€¦ why, then we shall know that there is no taint in your blood, and when you come into the flower of your womanhood, you shall wed the king in the Great Sept of Baelor, before the eyes of gods and men.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Perhapsâ€¦ if I might see my father, talk to him aboutâ€¦</quotetext>

		<quotetext>You disappoint me, Sansa,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>We&apos;ve told you of your father&apos;s crimes.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Lord Eddard has not been harmed,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>I&apos;llâ€¦ I&apos;ll write the letters,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>beyond a doubt.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>8548</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And this one was Jafer Flowers.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8549</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They were Ben Stark&apos;s men, both of them.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Gods have mercy,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>You have to look,</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8553</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Maester Aemon sent you to be his eyes, didn&apos;t he?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8554</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What good are eyes if they&apos;re shut?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8555</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes, butâ€¦ I&apos;m such a coward, Jon.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8556</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We have a dozen rangers with us, and the dogs, even Ghost.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>8557</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No one will hurt you, Sam.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8558</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Go ahead and look.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8559</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The first look is the hardest.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>8560</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ser Jaremy,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8561</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ben Stark had six men with him when he rode from the Wall.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8562</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Where are the others?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8563</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Would that I knew.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8564</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Two of our brothers butchered almost within sight of the Wall, yet your rangers heard nothing, saw nothing.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8565</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Is this what the Night&apos;s Watch has fallen to?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8566</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do we still sweep these woods?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8567</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes, my lord, butâ€”</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8568</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do we still mount watches?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8569</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We do, butâ€”</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8570</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This man wears a hunting horn.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8571</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Must I suppose that he died without sounding it?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8572</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Or have your rangers all gone deaf as well as blind?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8573</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No horn was blown, my lord, or my rangers would have heard it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8574</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I do not have sufficient men to mount as many patrols as I should likeâ€¦ and since Benjen was lost, we have stayed closer to the Wall than we were wont to do before, by your own command.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8575</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8576</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8577</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Be that as it may.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8578</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Tell me how they died.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8579</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This was done with an axe.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8580</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Aye,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8581</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Belike the axe that Othor carried, m&apos;lord.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8582</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The wildlings have axes too.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8583</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So you believe this is Mance Rayder&apos;s work?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8584</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This close to the Wall?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8585</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Who else, my lord?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8586</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If Ben Stark had come under wildling attack a half day&apos;s ride from Castle Black, he would have returned for more men, chased the killers through all seven hells and brought me back their heads.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8587</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Unless he was slain as well,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8588</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It has been close on half a year since Benjen left us, my lord,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8589</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The forest is vast.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8590</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The wildlings might have fallen on him anywhere.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8591</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;d wager these two were the last survivors of his party, on their way back to usâ€¦ but the enemy caught them before they could reach the safety of the Wall.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8592</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The corpses are still fresh, these men cannot have been dead more than a dayâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8593</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8594</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I did not ask for your views, boy,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8595</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Let him speak, ser,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8596</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If the lad has something to say, I&apos;ll hear him out.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8597</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Come closer, boy.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8598</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We can&apos;t see you behind those horses.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8599</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My lord, itâ€¦ it can&apos;t be a day orâ€¦ lookâ€¦ the bloodâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8600</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8601</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Blood, what of it?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8602</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He soils his smallclothes at the sight of it,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8603</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Youâ€¦ you can see where Ghostâ€¦ Jon&apos;s direwolfâ€¦ you can see where he tore off that man&apos;s hand, and yetâ€¦ the stump hasn&apos;t bled, lookâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8604</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My fatherâ€¦ L-lord Randyll, he, he made me watch him dress animals sometimes, whenâ€¦ afterâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8605</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A fresh killâ€¦ the blood would still flow, my lords.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8606</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Laterâ€¦ later it would be clotted, like aâ€¦ a jelly, thick andâ€¦ andâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8607</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This manâ€¦ look at the wrist, it&apos;s allâ€¦ crustyâ€¦ dryâ€¦ likeâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8608</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If they&apos;d been dead much longer than a day, they&apos;d be ripe by now, boy.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8609</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They don&apos;t even smell.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8610</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well, they&apos;re no pansy flowers, butâ€¦ m&apos;lord has the truth of it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8611</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There&apos;s no corpse stink.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8612</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Theyâ€¦ they aren&apos;t rotting.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8613</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Look, there&apos;sâ€¦ there&apos;s no maggots orâ€¦ orâ€¦ worms or anythingâ€¦ they&apos;ve been lying here in the woods, but theyâ€¦ they haven&apos;t been chewed or eaten by animalsâ€¦ only Ghostâ€¦ otherwise they&apos;reâ€¦ they&apos;reâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8614</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Untouched,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8615</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And Ghost is different.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8616</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The dogs and the horses won&apos;t go near them.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8617</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Chett, bring the hounds closer.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8618</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Thisâ€¦ this is all wrong,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8619</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The bloodâ€¦ there&apos;s bloodstains on their clothes, andâ€¦ and their flesh, dry and hard, butâ€¦ there&apos;s none on the ground, orâ€¦ anywhere.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8620</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>With thoseâ€¦ thoseâ€¦ thoseâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8621</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>With those woundsâ€¦ terrible woundsâ€¦ there should be blood all over.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8622</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Shouldn&apos;t there?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8623</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Might be they didn&apos;t die here.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8624</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Might be someone brought â€™em and left â€™em for us.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8625</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A warning, as like.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8626</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And might be I&apos;m a fool, but I don&apos;t know that Othor never had no blue eyes afore.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8627</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Neither did Flowers,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8628</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Burn them,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8629</quoteindex>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8630</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Not yet.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8631</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I want Maester Aemon to have a look at them.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8632</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We&apos;ll bring them back to the Wall.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8633</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I will have these woods searched,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8634</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Every tree, every rock, every bush, and every foot of muddy ground within ten leagues of here.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8635</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Use all the men you have, and if you do not have enough, borrow hunters and foresters from the stewards.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8636</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If Ben and the others are out here, dead or alive, I will have them found.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8637</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And if there is anyone else in these woods, I will know of it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8638</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You are to track them and take them, alive if possible.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8639</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Is that understood?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8640</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It is, my lord,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quoteindex>8649</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What is it, man?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8653</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Jon, see to my horse, and tell Ser Jaremy to put the dead men in a storeroom until the maester is ready for them.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8658</quoteindex>

		<quotetext>Jon, I&apos;m sorry.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>I won&apos;t lie to you, it&apos;s grievous news.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8685</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I never thought to see another king, not at my age, with Robert half my years and strong as a bull.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8686</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They say the king loved to hunt.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8687</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The things we love destroy us every time, lad.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>My son loved that young wife of his.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8690</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Vain woman.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8691</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If not for her, he would never have thought to sell those poachers.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>My lord, I don&apos;t understand.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8693</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What&apos;s happened to my father?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8694</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I told you to sit,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8695</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Sit,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8696</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And have a drink, damn you.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>Lord Eddard has been imprisoned.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8699</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He is charged with treason.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8700</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It is said he plotted with Robert&apos;s brothers to deny the throne to Prince Joffrey.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8701</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8702</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That couldn&apos;t be.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>It is not for me to say.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>8706</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Nor for you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8707</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But it&apos;s a lie,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8708</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My lord, what will happen to him?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8709</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Will they kill him?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8710</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>As to that, I cannot say, lad.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8711</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I mean to send a letter.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8712</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I knew some of the king&apos;s councillors in my youth.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8713</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Old Pycelle, Lord Stannis, Ser Barristanâ€¦ Whatever your father has done, or hasn&apos;t done, he is a great lord.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8714</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He must be allowed to take the black and join us here.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8715</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Gods knows, we need men of Lord Eddard&apos;s ability.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8716</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My lord, will the king listen to you?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8717</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A boy kingâ€¦ I imagine he&apos;ll listen to his mother.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8718</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A pity the dwarf isn&apos;t with them.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8719</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He&apos;s the lad&apos;s uncle, and he saw our need when he visited us.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8720</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It was a bad thing, your lady mother taking him captiveâ€”</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8721</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lady Stark is not my mother,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8722</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My lord, what of my sisters?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8723</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Arya and Sansa, they were with my father, do you knowâ€”</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8724</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Pycelle makes no mention of them, but doubtless they&apos;ll be treated gently.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8725</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I will ask about them when I write.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>If ever the realm needed a strong kingâ€¦ there are dark days and cold nights ahead, I feel it in my bonesâ€¦</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>8767</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How many is it now?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8768</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Twelve thousand men, or near enough as makes no matter.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8769</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How many knights?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8770</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Few enough,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8771</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>To be a knight, you must stand your vigil in a sept, and be anointed with the seven oils to consecrate your vows.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8772</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>In the north, only a few of the great houses worship the Seven.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8773</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The rest honor the old gods, and name no knightsâ€¦ but those lords and their sons and sworn swords are no less fierce or loyal or honorable.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>8774</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A man&apos;s worth is not marked by a ser before his name.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>As I have told you a hundred times before.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Still,</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>8777</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>how many knights?</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8778</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Three hundred, perhaps fourâ€¦ among three thousand armored lances who are not knights.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>8779</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Karstark is the last,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Robb will feast him tonight.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>8783</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He must march soon, or not at all,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8784</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The winter town is full to bursting, and this army of his will eat the countryside clean if it camps here much longer.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8785</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Others are waiting to join him all along the kingsroad, barrow knights and crannogmen and the Lords Manderly and Flint.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>And when we are done with the Lannisters,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8811</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>we will march back north, root you out of your keep, and hang you for an oathbreaker.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>My lord father taught me that it was death to bare steel against your liege lord,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>My brother killed one.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8878</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ten foot tall she was, and stunted at that.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8879</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They&apos;ve been known to grow big as twelve and thirteen feet.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8880</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Fierce things they are too, all hair and teeth, and the wives have beards like their husbands, so there&apos;s no telling them apart.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8881</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The women take human men for lovers, and it&apos;s from them the half bloods come.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8882</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It goes harder on the women they catch.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>But you don&apos;t know what I mean, do you, boy?</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Giants and worse than giants, Lordling.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8891</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I tried to tell your brother when he asked his questions, him and your maester and that smiley boy Greyjoy.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>The cold winds are rising, and men go out from their fires and never come backâ€¦ or if they do, they&apos;re not men no more, but only wights, with blue eyes and cold black hands.</quotetext>

	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8895</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He can call himself King-beyond-the-Wall all he likes, but he&apos;s still just another old black crow who flew down from the Shadow Tower.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8896</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He&apos;s never tasted winter.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>I was born up there, child, like my mother and her mother before her and her mother before her, born of the Free Folk.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>8898</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We remember.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>I tried to tell your lordling brother.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8900</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Only yesterday, when I saw him in the yard.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8901</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>â€˜M&apos;lord Stark,â€™ I called to him, respectful as you please, but he looked through me, and that sweaty oaf Greatjon Umber shoves me out of the path.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8902</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So be it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8903</quoteindex>

		<quotetext>Tell me.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Will he now?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8908</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We&apos;ll see.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8909</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You tell him this, m&apos;lord.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8910</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You tell him he&apos;s bound on marching the wrong way.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8911</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s north he should be taking his swords.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8912</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>North, not south.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8913</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You hear me?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8914</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ll tell him.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Brandon Stark, of Winterfell.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8917</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I welcome you to our fires,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8918</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>and offer you meat and mead in honor of our friendship.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8919</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>â€¦sooner die than live like that,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8920</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I don&apos;t want to be broken,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8921</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I want to be a knight.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8922</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There are some who call my order the knights of the mind,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8923</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You are a surpassing clever boy when you work at it, Bran.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8924</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Have you ever thought that you might wear a maester&apos;s chain?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8925</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There is no limit to what you might learn.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8926</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I want to learn magic,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8927</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The crow promised that I would fly.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8928</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I can teach you history, healing, herblore.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8929</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I can teach you the speech of ravens, and how to build a castle, and the way a sailor steers his ship by the stars.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8930</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I can teach you to measure the days and mark the seasons, and at the Citadel in Oldtown they can teach you a thousand things more.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8931</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But, Bran, no man can teach you magic.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8932</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The children could,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8933</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The children of the forest.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8934</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The wildling woman could give Old Nan lessons in telling tales, I think,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8935</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I will talk with her again if you like, but it would be best if you did not trouble your brother with this folly.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8936</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He has more than enough to concern him without fretting over giants and dead men in the woods.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8937</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s the Lannisters who hold your lord father, Bran, not the children of the forest.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8938</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Think on what I said, child.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>You are the lord in Winterfell now,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8940</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You must take my place, as I took Father&apos;s, until we come home.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8941</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I know,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8942</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Listen to Maester Luwin&apos;s counsel, and take care of Rickon.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8943</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Tell him that I&apos;ll be back as soon as the fighting is done.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8944</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8945</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>NO farewell!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8946</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I told him,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8947</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He says no one ever comes back.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8948</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He can&apos;t be a baby forever.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8949</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He&apos;s a Stark, and near four.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8950</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well, Mother will be home soon.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8951</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And I&apos;ll bring back Father, I promise.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>The stallion who mounts the world has no need of iron chairs.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8955</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It was prophesied that the stallion will ride to the ends of the earth,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Wooden horses with a hundred legs, that fly across the sea on wings full of wind.</quotetext>

	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8967</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He talks of leading his khalasar east after Rhaego is born, to plunder the lands around the Jade Sea.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8968</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The khal has never seen the Seven Kingdoms,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>They are nothing to him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8970</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If he thinks of them at all, no doubt he thinks of islands, a few small cities clinging to rocks in the manner of Lorath or Lys, surrounded by stormy seas.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8971</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The riches of the east must seem a more tempting prospect.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>But he must ride west,</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8987</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It was so alive there, all the people shouting and laughing, so many wonderful things to look atâ€¦ though we seldom had enough coin to buy anythingâ€¦ well, except for a sausage now and again, or honeyfingersâ€¦ do they have honeyfingers in the Seven Kingdoms, the kind they bake in Tyrosh?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8988</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Cakes, are they?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8989</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I could not say, Princess.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>those are the kind of sausages I meant.</quotetext>

	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9006</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It is good to see, Khaleesi.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Sweet reds,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9008</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have sweet reds, from Lys and Volantis and the Arbor.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9009</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Whites from Lys, Tyroshi pear brandy, firewine, pepperwine, the pale green nectars of Myr.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9010</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Smokeberry browns and Andalish sours, I have them, I have them.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>A taste for the khaleesi?</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9012</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have a sweet red from Dorne, my lady, it sings of plums and cherries and rich dark oak.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9013</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A cask, a cup, a swallow?</quotetext>

		<quotetext>One taste, and you will name your child after me.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>My son has his name, but I will try your summerwine,</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9019</quoteindex>

		<quotetext>That?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9025</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Dornish swill.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9026</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It is not worthy of a princess.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9027</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have a dry red from the Arbor, crisp and delectable.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>No.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>Aggo, put down that cask.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>9038</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ser Jorah, is something wrong?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9039</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have a thirst.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9040</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Open it, wineseller.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9041</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The wine is for the khaleesi, not for the likes of you, ser.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9042</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If you don&apos;t open it, I&apos;ll crack it open with your head.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9043</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Pour,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9044</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It would be a crime to drink this rich a wine without letting it breathe.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9045</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do as Ser Jorah says,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9046</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>As the princess commands.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9048</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Can you smell the fruit, ser?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9049</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The perfume of the Arbor.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9051</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You taste it first.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>9052</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Me?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9053</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I am not worthy of this vintage, my lord.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9054</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And it&apos;s a poor wine merchant who drinks up his own wares.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9055</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You will drink,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9056</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Empty the cup, or I will tell them to hold you down while Ser Jorah pours the whole cask down your throat.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9057</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No,</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>9059</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>His goods I gift to you as well, Princess,</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>9060</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Small token of regret, that one of mine would do this thing.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>9061</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How did you know?</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9062</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9063</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I did not know, Khaleesi, not until the man refused to drink, but once I read Magister Illyrio&apos;s letter, I feared.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9064</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Come.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9065</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Best not to talk of it here.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9066</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You are the blood of the dragon, little one,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9067</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You are the blood of the dragon, and the dragon does not fear.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9068</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Tell me,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9069</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Was it the Usurper?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9070</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9071</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A letter to Viserys, from Magister Illyrio.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9072</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Robert Baratheon offers lands and lordships for your death, or your brother&apos;s.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9073</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My brother?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9074</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He does not know yet, does he?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9075</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Usurper owes Drogo a lordship.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9076</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And me, you said.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9077</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Only me?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9078</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You and the child,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9079</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9080</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He cannot have my son.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9082</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Khaleesi?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9083</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It is so hot.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9084</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Are you certain?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9085</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9086</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Iâ€¦ I have a chill.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9087</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Light the brazier.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9088</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>As you command.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9089</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I shall make you a cloak of its skin, moon of my life,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9090</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This poisoner was the first,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9091</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>but he will not be the last.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9092</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Men will risk much for a lordship.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9093</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And to Rhaego son of Drogo, the stallion who will mount the world, to him I also pledge a gift.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9094</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>To him I will give this iron chair his mother&apos;s father sat in.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9095</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I will give him Seven Kingdoms.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9096</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I, Drogo, khal, will do this thing.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9097</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I will take my khalasar west to where the world ends, and ride the wooden horses across the black salt water as no khal has done before.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9098</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I will kill the men in the iron suits and tear down their stone houses.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9099</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I will rape their women, take their children as slaves, and bring their broken gods back to Vaes Dothrak to bow down beneath the Mother of Mountains.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9100</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This I vow, I, Drogo son of Bharbo.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9101</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This I swear before the Mother of Mountains, as the stars look down in witness.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9102</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They await our coming, my lady,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9103</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>as my lord father swore they would.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9104</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Let us not keep them waiting any longer, ser.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9105</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If I had thought to see war again in my lifetime, I should have eaten a few less eels,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9106</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My boys will see you safe to your son, though, have no fear.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9107</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>boys</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9108</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Gods have mercy,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9109</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This is Moat Cailin?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9110</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s no more than aâ€”</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9111</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>â€”death trap,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9112</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I know how it looks, Uncle.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9113</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I thought the same the first time I saw it, but Ned assured me that this ruin is more formidable than it seems.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9114</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The three surviving towers command the causeway from all sides, and any enemy must pass between them.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9115</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The bogs here are impenetrable, full of quicksands and suckholes and teeming with snakes.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9116</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>To assault any of the towers, an army would need to wade through waist-deep black muck, cross a moat full of lizard-lions, and scale walls slimy with moss, all the while exposing themselves to fire from archers in the other towers.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9117</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And when night falls, there are said to be ghosts, cold vengeful spirits of the north who hunger for southron blood.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9118</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Remind me not to linger here.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9119</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Last I looked, I was southron myself.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9120</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Mother?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9121</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;ve grown a beard,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9122</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9123</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I like it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9124</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It makes you look like my brother Edmure.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9125</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lady Catelyn,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9126</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>you are fair as ever, a welcome sight in troubled times.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9127</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I had not looked to see you here, my lady,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9128</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I had not thought to be here,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9129</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>until I came ashore at White Harbor, and Lord Wyman told me that Robb had called the banners.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9130</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You know his son, Ser Wendel.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9131</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And my uncle, Ser Brynden Tully, who has left my sister&apos;s service for mine.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9132</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Blackfish,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9133</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Thank you for joining us, ser.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9134</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We need men of your courage.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9135</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And you, Ser Wendel, I am glad to have you here.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9136</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Is Ser Rodrik with you as well, Mother?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9137</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ve missed him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9138</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ser Rodrik is on his way north from White Harbor.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9139</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have named him castellan and commanded him to hold Winterfell till our return.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9140</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Maester Luwin is a wise counsellor, but unskilled in the arts of war.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9141</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Have no fear on that count, Lady Stark,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9142</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Winterfell is safe.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9143</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We&apos;ll shove our swords up Tywin Lannister&apos;s bunghole soon enough, begging your pardons, and then it&apos;s on to the Red Keep to free Ned.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9144</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My lady, a question, as it please you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9145</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It is said that you hold Lord Tywin&apos;s dwarf son as captive.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9146</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Have you brought him to us?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9147</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I vow, we should make good use of such a hostage.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9148</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I did hold Tyrion Lannister, but no longer,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9149</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I was no more pleased than you, my lords.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9150</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The gods saw fit to free him, with some help from my fool of a sister.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9151</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Sister or no,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9152</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>if you try to steal my son, you will leave by the Moon Door.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9153</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No doubt we will have time for all this later, but my journey has fatigued me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9154</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I would speak with my son alone.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9155</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I know you will forgive me, my lords.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9156</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And you, Theon,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9157</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Edmure was sixteen when he grew his first whiskers.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9158</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I will be sixteen soon enough,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9159</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And you are fifteen now.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9160</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Fifteen, and leading a host to battle.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9161</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Can you understand why I might fear, Robb?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9162</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There was no one else.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9163</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No one?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9164</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Pray, who were those men I saw here a moment ago?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9165</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Roose Bolton, Rickard Karstark, Galbart and Robett Glover, the Greatjon, Helman Tallhartâ€¦ you might have given the command to any of them.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9166</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Gods be good, you might even have sent Theon, though he would not be my choice.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9167</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They are not Starks,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9168</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They are men, Robb, seasoned in battle.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9169</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You were fighting with wooden swords less than a year past.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9170</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I know,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9171</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Are youâ€¦ are you sending me back to Winterfell?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9172</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I should.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9173</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You ought never have left.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9174</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yet I dare not, not now.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9175</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You have come too far.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9176</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Someday these lords will look to you as their liege.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9177</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If I pack you off now, like a child being sent to bed without his supper, they will remember, and laugh about it in their cups.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9178</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The day will come when you need them to respect you, even fear you a little.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9179</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Laughter is poison to fear.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9180</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I will not do that to you, much as I might wish to keep you safe.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9181</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You have my thanks, Mother,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9182</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You are my firstborn, Robb.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9183</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have only to look at you to remember the day you came into the world, red-faced and squalling.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9184</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You knowâ€¦ about Father?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9185</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9186</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Manderly told me when I landed at White Harbor.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9187</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Have you had any word of your sisters?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9188</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There was a letter,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9189</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>One for you as well, but it came to Winterfell with mine.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9190</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This is the one she wrote me, I never thought to bring yours.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9191</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This is Cersei&apos;s letter, not your sister&apos;s,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9192</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The real message is in what Sansa does not say.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9193</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>All this about how kindly and gently the Lannisters are treating herâ€¦ I know the sound of a threat, even whispered.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9194</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They have Sansa hostage, and they mean to keep her.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9195</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There&apos;s no mention of Arya,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9196</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9197</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I had hopedâ€¦ if you still held the Imp, a trade of hostagesâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9198</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Is there word from the Eyrie?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9199</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I wrote to Aunt Lysa, asking help.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9200</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Has she called Lord Arryn&apos;s banners, do you know?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9201</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Will the knights of the Vale come join us?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9202</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Only one,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9203</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>the best of them, my uncleâ€¦ but Brynden Blackfish was a Tully first.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9204</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My sister is not about to stir beyond her Bloody Gate.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9205</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Mother, what are we going to do?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9206</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I brought this whole army together, eighteen thousand men, but I don&apos;tâ€¦ I&apos;m not certainâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9207</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What are you so afraid of, Robb?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9208</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Iâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9209</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If we marchâ€¦ even if we winâ€¦ the Lannisters hold Sansa, and Father.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9210</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They&apos;ll kill them, won&apos;t they?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9211</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They want us to think so.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9212</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You mean they&apos;re lying?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9213</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I do not know, Robb.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9214</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What I do know is that you have no choice.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9215</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If you go to King&apos;s Landing and swear fealty, you will never be allowed to leave.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9216</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If you turn your tail and retreat to Winterfell, your lords will lose all respect for you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9217</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Some may even go over to the Lannisters.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9218</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Then the queen, with that much less to fear, can do as she likes with her prisoners.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9219</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Our best hope, our only true hope, is that you can defeat the foe in the field.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9220</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If you should chance to take Lord Tywin or the Kingslayer captive, why then a trade might very well be possible, but that is not the heart of it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9221</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So long as you have power enough that they must fear you, Ned and your sister should be safe.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9222</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Cersei is wise enough to know that she may need them to make her peace, should the fighting go against her.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9223</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What if the fighting doesn&apos;t go against her?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9224</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What if it goes against us?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9225</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Robb, I will not soften the truth for you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9226</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If you lose, there is no hope for any of us.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9227</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They say there is naught but stone at the heart of Casterly Rock.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9228</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Remember the fate of Rhaegar&apos;s children.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9229</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Then I will not lose,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9230</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Tell me what you know of the fighting in the riverlands,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9231</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Less than a fortnight past, they fought a battle in the hills below the Golden Tooth,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9232</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Father must have known that, because he sent out some men to oppose them, under the king&apos;s own banner.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9233</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He gave the command to some southron lordling, Lord Erik or Derik or something like that, but Ser Raymun Darry rode with him, and the letter said there were other knights as well, and a force of Father&apos;s own guardsmen.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9234</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Only it was a trap.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9235</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Derik had no sooner crossed the Red Fork than the Lannisters fell upon him, the king&apos;s banner be damned, and Gregor Clegane took them in the rear as they tried to pull back across the Mummer&apos;s Ford.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9236</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This Lord Derik and a few others may have escaped, no one is certain, but Ser Raymun was killed, and most of our men from Winterfell.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9237</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Tywin has closed off the kingsroad, it&apos;s said, and now he&apos;s marching north toward Harrenhal, burning as he goes.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9238</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You mean to meet him here?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9239</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If he comes so far, but no one thinks he will,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9240</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ve sent word to Howland Reed, Father&apos;s old friend at Greywater Watch.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9241</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If the Lannisters come up the Neck, the crannogmen will bleed them every step of the way, but Galbart Glover says Lord Tywin is too smart for that, and Roose Bolton agrees.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9242</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He&apos;ll stay close to the Trident, they believe, taking the castles of the river lords one by one, until Riverrun stands alone.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9243</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We need to march south to meet him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9244</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Is that wise?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9245</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You are strongly placed here.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9246</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s said that the old Kings in the North could stand at Moat Cailin and throw back hosts ten times the size of their own.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9247</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes, but our food and supplies are running low, and this is not land we can live off easily.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9248</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We&apos;ve been waiting for Lord Manderly, but now that his sons have joined us, we need to march.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9249</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Marching is all very well,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9250</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>but where, and to what purpose?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9251</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What do you mean to do?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9252</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Greatjon thinks we should take the battle to Lord Tywin and surprise him,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9253</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>but the Glovers and the Karstarks feel we&apos;d be wiser to go around his army and join up with Uncle Ser Edmure against the Kingslayer.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9254</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Though by the time we reach Riverrunâ€¦ I&apos;m not certainâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9255</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Be certain,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9256</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>or go home and take up that wooden sword again.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9257</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You cannot afford to seem indecisive in front of men like Roose Bolton and Rickard Karstark.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9258</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Make no mistake, Robbâ€”these are your bannermen, not your friends.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9259</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You named yourself battle commander.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9260</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Command.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9261</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>As you say, Mother.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9262</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ll ask you again.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9263</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What do you mean to do?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9264</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Both plans have virtues, butâ€¦ look, if we try to swing around Lord Tywin&apos;s host, we take the risk of being caught between him and the Kingslayer, and if we attack himâ€¦ by all reports, he has more men than I do, and a lot more armored horse.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9265</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Greatjon says that won&apos;t matter if we catch him with his breeches down, but it seems to me that a man who has fought as many battles as Tywin Lannister won&apos;t be so easily surprised.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9266</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Good,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9267</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Tell me more.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9268</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;d leave a small force here to hold Moat Cailin, archers mostly, and march the rest down the causeway,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9269</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>but once we&apos;re below the Neck, I&apos;d split our host in two.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9270</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The foot can continue down the kingsroad, while our horsemen cross the Green Fork at the Twins.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9271</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>When Lord Tywin gets word that we&apos;ve come south, he&apos;ll march north to engage our main host, leaving our riders free to hurry down the west bank to Riverrun.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9272</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;d put a river between the two parts of your army.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9273</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And between Jaime and Lord Tywin,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9274</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There&apos;s no crossing on the Green Fork above the ruby ford, where Robert won his crown.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9275</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Not until the Twins, all the way up here, and Lord Frey controls that bridge.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9276</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He&apos;s your father&apos;s bannerman, isn&apos;t that so?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9277</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He is,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9278</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>but my father has never trusted him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9279</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Nor should you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9280</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I won&apos;t,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9281</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What do you think?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9282</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Which force would you command?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9283</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The horse,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9284</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And the other?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9285</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Greatjon is always saying that we should smash Lord Tywin.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9286</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I thought I&apos;d give him the honor.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9287</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your father once told me that the Greatjon was as fearless as any man he had ever known.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9288</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Grey Wind ate two of his fingers, and he laughed about it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9289</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So you agree, then?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9290</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your father is not fearless,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9291</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He is brave, but that is very different.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9292</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The eastern host will be all that stands between Lord Tywin and Winterfell,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9293</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well, them and whatever few bowmen I leave here at the Moat.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9294</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So I don&apos;t want someone fearless, do I?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9295</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9296</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You want cold cunning, I should think, not courage.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9297</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Roose Bolton,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9298</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That man scares me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9299</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Then let us pray he will scare Tywin Lannister as well.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9300</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ll give the commands, and assemble an escort to take you home to Winterfell.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9301</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I am not going to Winterfell,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9302</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My father may be dying behind the walls of Riverrun.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9303</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My brother is surrounded by foes.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9304</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I must go to them.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9305</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>By their fires I call them twenty thousand strong,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9306</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Their banners are red, with a golden lion.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9307</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your father?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9308</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Or my brother Jaime,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9309</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We shall know soon enough.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9310</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It might be best if I rode down alone,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9311</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Best for Tyrion son of Tywin,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9312</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Shagga son of Dolf likes this not.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9313</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Shagga will go with the boyman, and if the boyman lies, Shagga will chop off his manhoodâ€”</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9314</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>â€”and feed it to the goats, yes,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9315</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Shagga, I give you my word as a Lannister, I will return.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9316</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why should we trust your word?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9317</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lowland lords have lied to the clans before.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9318</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You wound me, Chella,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9319</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Here I thought we had become such friends.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9320</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But as you will.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>You shall ride with me, and Shagga and Conn for the Stone Crows, Ulf for the Moon Brothers, and Timett son of Timett for the Burned Men.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9322</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The rest shall wait here until I send for you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9323</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Try not to kill and maim each other while I&apos;m gone.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>I wonder what their king burned off,</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9325</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Who commands here?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9326</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ser Flement.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9327</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Tyrion,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9328</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My lord, we all feared you dead, orâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9329</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Theseâ€¦ companions of yoursâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9330</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Bosom friends and loyal retainers,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9331</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Where will I find my lord father?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9332</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He has taken the inn at the crossroads for his quarters.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9333</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I will see him at once.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9334</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>As you say, my lord.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9335</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A room, a meal, and a flagon of wine, that was all I asked,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9336</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The lad won&apos;t steal your mare,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9337</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He only wants to give her some oats and water and brush out her coat.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9338</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You have my word, the horse will not be harmed.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9339</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This is the horse of Shagga son of Dolf,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9340</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If he doesn&apos;t give her back, chop off his manhood and feed it to the goats,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9341</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Provided you can find some.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9342</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My father?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9343</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>In the common room, m&apos;lord.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9344</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My men will want meat and mead,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9345</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>See that they get it.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>9347</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Uncle,</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>9348</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And my lord father.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9349</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What a pleasure to find you here.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9350</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I see that the rumors of your demise were unfounded.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9351</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Sorry to disappoint you, Father,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9352</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No need to leap up and embrace me, I wouldn&apos;t want you to strain yourself.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9353</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Kind of you to go to war for me,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9354</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>By my lights, it was you who started this,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9355</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your brother Jaime would never have meekly submitted to capture at the hands of a woman.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9356</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That&apos;s one way we differ, Jaime and I.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9357</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He&apos;s taller as well, you may have noticed.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9358</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The honor of our House was at stake.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9359</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I had no choice but to ride.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9360</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No man sheds Lannister blood with impunity.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9361</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Hear Me Roar,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9362</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Truth be told, none of my blood was actually shed, although it was a close thing once or twice.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9363</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Morrec and Jyck were killed.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9364</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I suppose you will be wanting some new men.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9365</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Don&apos;t trouble yourself, Father, I&apos;ve acquired a few of my own.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9366</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How is your war going?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9367</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well enough, for the nonce.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9368</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ser Edmure had scattered small troops of men along his borders to stop our raiding, and your lord father and I were able to destroy most of them piecemeal before they could regroup.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9369</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your brother has been covering himself with glory,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9370</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He smashed the Lords Vance and Piper at the Golden Tooth, and met the massed power of the Tullys under the walls of Riverrun.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9371</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The lords of the Trident have been put to rout.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9372</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ser Edmure Tully was taken captive, with many of his knights and bannermen.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9373</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Blackwood led a few survivors back to Riverrun, where Jaime has them under siege.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9374</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The rest fled to their own strongholds.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9375</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your father and I have been marching on each in turn,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9376</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>With Lord Blackwood gone, Raventree fell at once, and Lady Whent yielded Harrenhal for want of men to defend it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9377</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ser Gregor burnt out the Pipers and the Brackensâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9378</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Leaving you unopposed?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9379</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Not wholly,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9380</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Mallisters still hold Seagard and Walder Frey is marshaling his levies at the Twins.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9381</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No matter,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9382</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Frey only takes the field when the scent of victory is in the air, and all he smells now is ruin.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9383</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And Jason Mallister lacks the strength to fight alone.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9384</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Once Jaime takes Riverrun, they will both be quick enough to bend the knee.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9385</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Unless the Starks and the Arryns come forth to oppose us, this war is good as won.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9386</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I would not fret overmuch about the Arryns if I were you,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9387</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Starks are another matter.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>Lord Eddardâ€”</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9389</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>â€”is our hostage,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9390</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He will lead no armies while he rots in a dungeon under the Red Keep.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9391</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9392</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>but his son has called the banners and sits at Moat Cailin with a strong host around him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9393</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No sword is strong until it&apos;s been tempered,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9394</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Stark boy is a child.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9395</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No doubt he likes the sound of warhorns well enough, and the sight of his banners fluttering in the wind, but in the end it comes down to butcher&apos;s work.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9396</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I doubt he has the stomach for it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9397</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And what is our fearless monarch doing whilst all this â€˜butcher&apos;s workâ€™ is being done?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9398</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How has my lovely and persuasive sister gotten Robert to agree to the imprisonment of his dear friend Ned?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9399</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Robert Baratheon is dead,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9400</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your nephew reigns in King&apos;s Landing.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>My sister, you mean.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9402</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If you have a mind to make yourself of use, I will give you a command,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9403</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Marq Piper and Karyl Vance are loose in our rear, raiding our lands across the Red Fork.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9404</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The gall of them, fighting back.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9405</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ordinarily I&apos;d be glad to punish such rudeness, Father, but the truth is, I have pressing business elsewhere.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9406</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do you?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9407</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We also have a pair of Ned Stark&apos;s afterthoughts making a nuisance of themselves by harassing my foraging parties.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9408</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Beric Dondarrion, some young lordling with delusions of valor.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9409</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He has that fat jape of a priest with him, the one who likes to set his sword on fire.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9410</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do you think you might be able to deal with them as you scamper off?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9411</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Without making too much a botch of it?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9412</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Father, it warms my heart to think that you might entrust me withâ€¦ what, twenty men?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9413</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Fifty?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9414</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Are you sure you can spare so many?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9415</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well, no matter.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9416</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If I should come across Thoros and Lord Beric, I shall spank them both.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9417</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>First, though, I have some promises of my own to keep,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9418</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I shall require three thousand helms and as many hauberks, plus swords, pikes, steel spearheads, maces, battleaxes, gauntlets, gorgets, greaves, breastplates, wagons to carry all thisâ€”</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9419</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Little redcape,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9420</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>when next you bare steel on Shagga son of Dolf, I will chop off your manhood and roast it in the fire.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>9421</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What, no goats?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9422</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Who might you be?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9423</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They followed me home, Father,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9424</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>May I keep them?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9425</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They don&apos;t eat much.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>By what right do you savages intrude on our councils?</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Savages, lowlander?</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>Which one is the lion lord?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9430</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They are both old men,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9431</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Tyrion, have you forgotten your courtesies?</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>I&apos;m no maid,</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>9437</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>May they take fifty more.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>This is Conn son of Coratt.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9439</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Shagga son of Dolf is the one who looks like Casterly Rock with hair.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>They are Stone Crows.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>Here is Ulf son of Umar of the Moon Brothers, and here Timett son of Timett, a red hand of the Burned Men.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9442</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And this is Bronn, a sellsword of no particular allegiance.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9443</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He has already changed sides twice in the short time I&apos;ve known him, you and he ought to get on famously, Father.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9444</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>May I present my lord father, Tywin son of Tytos of House Lannister, Lord of Casterly Rock, Warden of the West, Shield of Lannisport, and once and future Hand of the King.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9445</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Even in the west, we know the prowess of the warrior clans of the Mountains of the Moon.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>9446</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What brings you down from your strongholds, my lords?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9447</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Horses,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9448</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A promise of silk and steel,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>My lord,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9450</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ser Addam bid me tell you that the Stark host is moving down the causeway.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9451</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So the wolfling is leaving his den to play among the lions,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9452</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Splendid.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9453</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Return to Ser Addam and tell him to fall back.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9454</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He is not to engage the northerners until we arrive, but I want him to harass their flanks and draw them farther south.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9455</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It will be as you command.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9456</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We are well situated here,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9457</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Close to the ford and ringed by pits and spikes.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9458</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If they are coming south, I say let them come, and break themselves against us.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9459</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The boy may hang back or lose his courage when he sees our numbers,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9460</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The sooner the Starks are broken, the sooner I shall be free to deal with Stannis Baratheon.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9461</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Tell the drummers to beat assembly, and send word to Jaime that I am marching against Robb Stark.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9462</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>As you will,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9463</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It is said that the men of the mountain clans are warriors without fear.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9464</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It is said truly,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9465</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And the women,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9466</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ride with me against my enemies, and you shall have all my son promised you, and more,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9467</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Would you pay us with our own coin?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9468</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why should we need the father&apos;s promise, when we have the son&apos;s?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9469</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I said nothing of need,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9470</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My words were courtesy, nothing more.</quotetext>

	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>The men of the winterlands are made of iron and ice, and even my boldest knights fear to face them.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>9473</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Burned Men fear nothing.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>We ride as well.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Grand Maester Pycelle, I command you to read my decrees.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9489</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>In the place of the traitor Stannis Baratheon, it is the wish of His Grace that his lady mother, the Queen Regent Cersei Lannister, who has ever been his staunchest support, be seated upon his small council, that she may help him rule wisely and with justice.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9490</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So the king has decreed.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>9491</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The small council consents.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9492</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It is also the wish of His Grace that his loyal servant, Janos Slynt, Commander of the City Watch of King&apos;s Landing, be at once raised to the rank of lord and granted the ancient seat of Harrenhal with all its attendant lands and incomes, and that his sons and grandsons shall hold these honors after him until the end of time.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9493</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It is moreover his command that Lord Slynt be seated immediately upon his small council, to assist in the governance of the realm.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9494</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So the king has decreed.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>The small council consents.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9496</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lastly, in these times of treason and turmoil, with our beloved Robert so lately dead, it is the view of the council that the life and safety of King Joffrey is of paramount importanceâ€¦</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>9503</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yet now I fear your service is at an end.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>You let my father die,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>I was chosen for the White Swords in my twenty-third year.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9518</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It was all I had ever dreamed, from the moment I first took sword in hand.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9519</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I gave up all claim to my ancestral keep.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>9520</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The girl I was to wed married my cousin in my place, I had no need of land or sons, my life would be lived for the realm.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9521</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ser Gerold Hightower himself heard my vowsâ€¦ to ward the king with all my strengthâ€¦ to give my blood for hisâ€¦ I fought beside the White Bull and Prince Lewyn of Dorneâ€¦ beside Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9522</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Before I served your father, I helped shield King Aerys, and his father Jaehaerys before himâ€¦ three kingsâ€¦</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>9523</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And all of them dead,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Have a care for your words, ser,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>We are not unmindful of your service, good ser.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Lord Tywin Lannister has generously agreed to grant you a handsome tract of land north of Lannisport, beside the sea, with gold and men sufficient to build you a stout keep, and servants to see to your every need.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9533</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A hall to die in, and men to bury me.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>9534</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I thank you, my lordsâ€¦ but I spit upon your pity.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>9535</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I am a knight,</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>9536</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I shall die a knight.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9537</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A naked knight, it would seem,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9538</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Have no fear, sers, your king is safeâ€¦ no thanks to you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9539</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Even now, I could cut through the five of you as easy as a dagger cuts cheese.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9540</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If you would serve under the Kingslayer, not a one of you is fit to wear the white.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9541</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Here, boy.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9542</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Melt it down and add it to the others, if you like.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9543</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It will do you more good than the swords in the hands of these five.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9544</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Perhaps Lord Stannis will chance to sit on it when he takes your throne.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9545</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He called me boy,</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>Without meaningâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9549</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He could be making plots with my uncles.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9550</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I want him seized and questioned.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>Tell them, Mother.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>The king and council have determined that no man in the Seven Kingdoms is more fit to guard and protect His Grace than his sworn shield, Sandor Clegane.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>9559</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How do you like that, dog?</quotetext>

		<quotetext>I do.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Sansa, you disappoint me.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>What did I tell you about traitor&apos;s blood?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9574</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your father has committed grave and terrible crimes, my lady,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Ah, poor sad thing,</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>9582</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do you deny your father&apos;s crime?</quotetext>

		<quotetext>He was King Robert&apos;s friend and he loved him, you all know he loved him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9588</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He never wanted to be Hand until the king asked him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9589</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They must have lied to him.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>Lord Renly or Lord Stannis orâ€¦ or somebody, they must have lied, otherwiseâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9591</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He said I wasn&apos;t the king.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>9592</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why did he say that?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9593</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>His leg was broken,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9594</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It hurt ever so much, Maester Pycelle was giving him milk of the poppy, and they say that milk of the poppy fills your head with clouds.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9595</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Otherwise he would never have said it.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>If Lord Eddard were to confess his crime,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>I shall do as you askâ€¦ but first your father has to confess.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>9605</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He has to confess and say that I&apos;m the king, or there will be no mercy for him.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>The younger girl escaped Ser Meryn and fled,</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9648</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have not been able to find her.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Nor have the Lannisters.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>A kindness, there.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>9651</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Our new king loves her not.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Your older girl is still betrothed to Joffrey.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9653</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Cersei keeps her close.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9654</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She came to court a few days ago to plead that you be spared.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9655</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A pity you couldn&apos;t have been there, you would have been touched.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>I trust you realize that you are a dead man, Lord Eddard?</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>9657</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The queen will not kill me,</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>9658</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Catâ€¦ Cat holds her brotherâ€¦</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>9659</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The wrong brother,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9660</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And lost to her, in any case.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9661</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She let the Imp slip through her fingers.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9662</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I expect he is dead by now, somewhere in the Mountains of the Moon.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>9663</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If that is true, slit my throat and have done with it.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Your blood is the last thing I desire.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9665</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>When they slaughtered my guard, you stood beside the queen and watched, and said not a word.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9666</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And would again.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9667</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I seem to recall that I was unarmed, unarmored, and surrounded by Lannister swords.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9668</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>When I was a young boy, before I was cut, I traveled with a troupe of mummers through the Free Cities.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9669</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They taught me that each man has a role to play, in life as well as mummery.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9670</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So it is at court.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9671</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The King&apos;s Justice must be fearsome, the master of coin must be frugal, the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard must be valiantâ€¦ and the master of whisperers must be sly and obsequious and without scruple.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9672</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A courageous informer would be as useless as a cowardly knight.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>9673</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Can you free me from this pit?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9674</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I couldâ€¦ but will I?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9675</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9676</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Questions would be asked, and the answers would lead back to me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9677</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You are blunt.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9678</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A eunuch has no honor, and a spider does not enjoy the luxury of scruples, my lord.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9679</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Would you at least consent to carry a message out for me?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9680</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That would depend on the message.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9681</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I will gladly provide you with paper and ink, if you like.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9682</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And when you have written what you will, I will take the letter and read it, and deliver it or not, as best serves my own ends.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9683</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your own ends.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9684</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What ends are those, Lord Varys?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9685</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Peace,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9686</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If there was one soul in King&apos;s Landing who was truly desperate to keep Robert Baratheon alive, it was me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9687</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>For fifteen years I protected him from his enemies, but I could not protect him from his friends.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9688</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What strange fit of madness led you to tell the queen that you had learned the truth of Joffrey&apos;s birth?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9689</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The madness of mercy,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9690</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ah,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9691</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>To be sure.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9692</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You are an honest and honorable man, Lord Eddard.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9693</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ofttimes I forget that.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9694</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have met so few of them in my life.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9695</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>When I see what honesty and honor have won you, I understand why.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9696</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The king&apos;s wineâ€¦ did you question Lancel?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9697</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, indeed.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9698</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Cersei gave him the wineskins, and told him it was Robert&apos;s favorite vintage.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9699</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A hunter lives a perilous life.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9700</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If the boar had not done for Robert, it would have been a fall from a horse, the bite of a wood adder, an arrow gone astrayâ€¦ the forest is the abbatoir of the gods.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9701</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It was not wine that killed the king.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9702</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It was your mercy.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9703</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Gods forgive me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9704</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If there are gods,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9705</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I expect they will.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9706</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The queen would not have waited long in any case.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9707</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Robert was becoming unruly, and she needed to be rid of him to free her hands to deal with his brothers.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9708</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They are quite a pair, Stannis and Renly.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9709</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The iron gauntlet and the silk glove.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9710</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You have been foolish, my lord.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9711</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You ought to have heeded Littlefinger when he urged you to support Joffrey&apos;s succession.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9712</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Howâ€¦ how could you know of that?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9713</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I know, that&apos;s all that need concern you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9714</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I also know that on the morrow the queen will pay you a visit.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9715</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9716</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Cersei is frightened of you, my lordâ€¦ but she has other enemies she fears even more.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9717</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Her beloved Jaime is fighting the river lords even now.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9718</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lysa Arryn sits in the Eyrie, ringed in stone and steel, and there is no love lost between her and the queen.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9719</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>In Dorne, the Martells still brood on the murder of Princess Elia and her babes.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9720</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And now your son marches down the Neck with a northern host at his back.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9721</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Robb is only a boy,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9722</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A boy with an army,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9723</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yet only a boy, as you say.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9724</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The king&apos;s brothers are the ones giving Cersei sleepless nightsâ€¦ Lord Stannis in particular.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9725</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>His claim is the true one, he is known for his prowess as a battle commander, and he is utterly without mercy.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9726</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There is no creature on earth half so terrifying as a truly just man.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9727</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No one knows what Stannis has been doing on Dragonstone, but I will wager you that he&apos;s gathered more swords than seashells.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9728</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So here is Cersei&apos;s nightmare: while her father and brother spend their power battling Starks and Tullys, Lord Stannis will land, proclaim himself king, and lop off her son&apos;s curly blond headâ€¦ and her own in the bargain, though I truly believe she cares more about the boy.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9729</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Stannis Baratheon is Robert&apos;s true heir,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9730</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The throne is his by rights.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9731</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I would welcome his ascent.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9732</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Cersei will not want to hear that, I promise you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9733</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Stannis may win the throne, but only your rotting head will remain to cheer unless you guard that tongue of yours.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9734</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Sansa begged so sweetly, it would be a shame if you threw it all away.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9735</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You are being given your life back, if you&apos;ll take it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9736</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Cersei is no fool.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9737</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She knows a tame wolf is of more use than a dead one.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9738</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You want me to serve the woman who murdered my king, butchered my men, and crippled my son?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9739</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I want you to serve the realm,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9740</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Tell the queen that you will confess your vile treason, command your son to lay down his sword, and proclaim Joffrey as the true heir.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9741</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Offer to denounce Stannis and Renly as faithless usurpers.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9742</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Our green-eyed lioness knows you are a man of honor.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9743</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If you will give her the peace she needs and the time to deal with Stannis, and pledge to carry her secret to your grave, I believe she will allow you to take the black and live out the rest of your days on the Wall, with your brother and that baseborn son of yours.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9744</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Is this your own scheme,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9745</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>or are you in league with Littlefinger?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9746</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I would sooner wed the Black Goat of Qohor.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9747</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Littlefinger is the second most devious man in the Seven Kingdoms.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9748</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, I feed him choice whispers, sufficient so that he thinks I am hisâ€¦ just as I allow Cersei to believe I am hers.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9749</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And just as you let me believe that you were mine.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9750</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Tell me, Lord Varys, who do you truly serve?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9751</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why, the realm, my good lord, how ever could you doubt that?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9752</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I swear it by my lost manhood.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9753</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I serve the realm, and the realm needs peace.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9754</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So what is your answer, Lord Eddard?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9755</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Give me your word that you&apos;ll tell the queen what she wants to hear when she comes calling.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9756</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If I did, my word would be as hollow as an empty suit of armor.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9757</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My life is not so precious to me as that.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9758</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Pity.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9759</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And your daughter&apos;s life, my lord?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9760</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How precious is that?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9761</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My daughterâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9762</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Surely you did not think I&apos;d forgotten about your sweet innocent, my lord?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9763</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The queen most certainly has not.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9764</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9765</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Varys, gods have mercy, do as you like with me, but leave my daughter out of your schemes.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9766</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Sansa&apos;s no more than a child.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9767</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Rhaenys was a child too.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9768</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Prince Rhaegar&apos;s daughter.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9769</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A precious little thing, younger than your girls.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9770</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She had a small black kitten she called Balerion, did you know?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9771</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I always wondered what happened to him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9772</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Rhaenys liked to pretend he was the true Balerion, the Black Dread of old, but I imagine the Lannisters taught her the difference between a kitten and a dragon quick enough, the day they broke down her door.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9773</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The choice, my dear lord Hand, is entirely yours.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9774</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Late again,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9775</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Four thousand men,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9776</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Frey cannot hope to fight the Lannisters by himself.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9777</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Surely he means to join his power to ours.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9778</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Does he?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9779</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I wonder.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9780</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Expect nothing of Walder Frey, and you will never be surprised.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9781</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He&apos;s your father&apos;s bannerman.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9782</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Some men take their oaths more seriously than others, Robb.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9783</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And Lord Walder was always friendlier with Casterly Rock than my father would have liked.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9784</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>One of his sons is wed to Tywin Lannister&apos;s sister.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9785</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That means little of itself, to be sure.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9786</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Walder has sired a great many children over the years, and they must needs marry someone.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9787</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Stillâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9788</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do you think he means to betray us to the Lannisters, my lady?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9789</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If truth be told, I doubt even Lord Frey knows what Lord Frey intends to do.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9790</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He has an old man&apos;s caution and a young man&apos;s ambition, and has never lacked for cunning.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9791</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We must have the Twins, Mother,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9792</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There is no other way across the river.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9793</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You know that.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9794</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>And so does Walder Frey, you can be sure of that.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9796</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ser Brynden says to tell you he&apos;s crossed swords with the Lannisters.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9797</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There are a dozen scouts who won&apos;t be reporting back to Lord Tywin anytime soon.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9798</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Or ever.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9799</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ser Addam Marbrand commands their outriders, and he&apos;s pulling back south, burning as he goes.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9800</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He knows where we are, more or less, but the Blackfish vows he will not know when we split.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9801</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Unless Lord Frey tells him,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9802</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Theon, when you return to my uncle, tell him he is to place his best bowmen around the Twins, day and night, with orders to bring down any raven they see leaving the battlements.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9803</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I want no birds bringing word of my son&apos;s movements to Lord Tywin.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9804</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ser Brynden has seen to it already, my lady,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9805</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A few more blackbirds, and we should have enough to bake a pie.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9806</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ll save you their feathers for a hat.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>What have the Freys been doing while the Lannisters burn their fields and plunder their holdfasts?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9808</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There&apos;s been some fighting between Ser Addam&apos;s men and Lord Walder&apos;s,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9809</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Not a day&apos;s ride from here, we found two Lannister scouts feeding the crows where the Freys had strung them up.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9810</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Most of Lord Walder&apos;s strength remains massed at the Twins, though.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9811</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If he&apos;s been fighting the Lannisters, perhaps he does mean to hold to his vows,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9812</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Defending his own lands is one thing, open battle against Lord Tywin quite another.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9813</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Has the Blackfish found any other way across the Green Fork?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9814</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The river&apos;s running high and fast.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9815</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ser Brynden says it can&apos;t be forded, not this far north.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9816</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I must have that crossing!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9817</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, our horses might be able to swim the river, I suppose, but not with armored men on their backs.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9818</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We&apos;d need to build rafts to pole our steel across, helms and mail and lances, and we don&apos;t have the trees for that.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9819</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Or the time.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9820</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Tywin is marching northâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9821</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Frey would be a fool to try and bar our way,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9822</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We have five times his numbers.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9823</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You can take the Twins if you need to, Robb.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9824</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Not easily,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9825</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>and not in time.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9826</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>While you were mounting your siege, Tywin Lannister would bring up his host and assault you from the rear.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9827</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What would my lord father do?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9828</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Find a way across,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9829</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Whatever it took.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9830</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There has been a battle under the walls of Riverrun,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9831</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We had it from a Lannister outrider we took captive.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9832</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Kingslayer has destroyed Edmure&apos;s host and sent the lords of the Trident reeling in flight.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9833</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And my brother?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9834</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Wounded and taken prisoner,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9835</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Blackwood and the other survivors are under siege inside Riverrun, surrounded by Jaime&apos;s host.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9836</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We must get across this accursed river if we&apos;re to have any hope of relieving them in time.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9837</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That will not be easily done,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9838</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Frey has pulled his whole strength back inside his castles, and his gates are closed and barred.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9839</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Damn the man,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9840</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If the old fool does not relent and let me cross, he&apos;ll leave me no choice but to storm his walls.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9841</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ll pull the Twins down around his ears if I have to, we&apos;ll see how well he likes that!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9842</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You sound like a sulky boy, Robb,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9843</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A child sees an obstacle, and his first thought is to run around it or knock it down.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9844</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A lord must learn that sometimes words can accomplish what swords cannot.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9845</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Tell me what you mean, Mother,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9846</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Freys have held the crossing for six hundred years, and for six hundred years they have never failed to exact their toll.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9847</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What toll?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9848</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What does he want?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9849</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That is what we must discover.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9850</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And what if I do not choose to pay this toll?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9851</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Then you had best retreat back to Moat Cailin, deploy to meet Lord Tywin in battleâ€¦ or grow wings.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9852</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I see no other choices.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9853</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That cannot be assaulted, my lords,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9854</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Nor can we take it by siege, without an army on the far bank to invest the other castle,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9855</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Even if we had the time.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9856</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Which, to be sure, we do not.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9857</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My lord father has sent me to greet you, and inquire as to who leads this mighty host.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9858</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I do.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9859</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My lord father would be most honored if you would share meat and mead with him in the castle and explain your purpose here.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9860</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You must not do this, my lord,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9861</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Walder is not to be trusted.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9862</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Go in there alone and you&apos;re his.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9863</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He can sell you to the Lannisters, throw you in a dungeon, or slit your throat, as he likes.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9864</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If he wants to talk to us, let him open his gates, and we will all share his meat and mead,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9865</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Or let him come out and treat with Robb here, in plain sight of his men and ours,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9866</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I will go,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9867</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You, my lady?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9868</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Mother, are you certain?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9869</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Never more,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9870</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Walder is my father&apos;s bannerman.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9871</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have known him since I was a girl.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9872</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He would never offer me any harm.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9873</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I am certain my lord father would be pleased to speak to the Lady Catelyn,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9874</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>To vouchsafe for our good intentions, my brother Ser Perwyn will remain here until she is safely returned to you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9875</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He shall be our honored guest,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9876</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I require my lady mother&apos;s return by evenfall, Ser Stevron,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9877</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It is not my intent to linger here long.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9878</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>As you say, my lord.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9879</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It is a great pleasure to see you again after so many years, my lord,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9880</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Is it?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9881</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I doubt that.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9882</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Spare me your sweet words, Lady Catelyn, I am too old.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9883</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why are you here?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9884</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Is your boy too proud to come before me himself?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9885</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What am I to do with you?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9886</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Father,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9887</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>you forget yourself.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9888</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lady Stark is here at your invitation.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9889</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Did I ask you?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9890</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You are not Lord Frey yet, not until I die.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9891</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do I look dead?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9892</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ll hear no instructions from you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9893</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This is no way to speak in front of our noble guest, Father,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9894</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Now my bastards presume to teach me courtesy,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9895</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ll speak any way I like, damn you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9896</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ve had three kings to guest in my life, and queens as well, do you think I require lessons from the likes of you, Ryger?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9897</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your mother was milking goats the first time I gave her my seed.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9898</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Danwell, Whalen, help me to my chair.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9899</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9900</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Now that I have observed the courtesies, my lady, perhaps my sons will do me the honor of shutting their mouths.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9901</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why are you here?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9902</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>To ask you to open your gates, my lord,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9903</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My son and his lords bannermen are most anxious to cross the river and be on their way.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9904</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>To Riverrun?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9905</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, no need to tell me, no need.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9906</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m not blind yet.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9907</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The old man can still read a map.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9908</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>To Riverrun,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9909</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Where I might have expected to find you, my lord.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9910</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You are still my father&apos;s bannerman, are you not?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9911</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Heh,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9912</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I called my swords, yes I did, here they are, you saw them on the walls.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9913</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It was my intent to march as soon as all my strength was assembled.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9914</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well, to send my sons.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9915</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I am well past marching myself, Lady Catelyn.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9916</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Tell her, Jared.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9917</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Tell her that was my intent.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9918</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It was, my lady,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9919</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>On my honor.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9920</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Is it my fault that your fool brother lost his battle before we could march?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9921</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I am told the Kingslayer went through him like an axe through ripe cheese.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9922</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why should my boys hurry south to die?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9923</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>All those who did go south are running north again.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9924</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>All the more reason that we must reach Riverrun, and soon.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9925</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Where can we go to talk, my lord?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9926</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We&apos;re talking now,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9927</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What are you all looking at?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9928</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Get out of here.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9929</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lady Stark wants to speak to me in private.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9930</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Might be she has designs on my fidelity, heh.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9931</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Go, all of you, find something useful to do.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9932</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes, you too, woman.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9933</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Out, out, out.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9934</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They&apos;re all waiting for me to die.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9935</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Stevron&apos;s been waiting for forty years, but I keep disappointing him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9936</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Heh.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9937</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why should I die just so he can be a lord?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9938</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I ask you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9939</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I won&apos;t do it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9940</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have every hope that you will live to be a hundred.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9941</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That would boil them, to be sure.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9942</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, to be sure.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9943</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Now, what do you want to say?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9944</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We want to cross,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9945</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, do you?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9946</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That&apos;s blunt.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9947</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why should I let you?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9948</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If you were strong enough to climb your own battlements, Lord Frey, you would see that my son has twenty thousand men outside your walls.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9949</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They&apos;ll be twenty thousand fresh corpses when Lord Tywin gets here,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9950</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Don&apos;t you try and frighten me, my lady.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9951</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your husband&apos;s in some traitor&apos;s cell under the Red Keep, your father&apos;s sick, might be dying, and Jaime Lannister&apos;s got your brother in chains.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9952</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What do you have that I should fear?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>That son of yours?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9954</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ll match you son for son, and I&apos;ll still have eighteen when yours are all dead.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9955</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You swore an oath to my father,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9956</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, yes, I said some words, but I swore oaths to the crown too, it seems to me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9957</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Joffrey&apos;s the king now, and that makes you and your boy and all those fools out there no better than rebels.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9958</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If I had the sense the gods gave a fish, I&apos;d help the Lannisters boil you all.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Lord Tywin the proud and splendid, Warden of the West, Hand of the King, oh, what a great man that one is, him and his gold this and gold that and lions here and lions there.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9961</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ll wager you, he eats too many beans, he breaks wind just like me, but you&apos;ll never hear him admit it, oh, no.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9962</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What&apos;s he got to be so puffed up about anyway?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9963</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Only two sons, and one of them&apos;s a twisted little monster.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9964</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ll match him son for son, and I&apos;ll still have nineteen and a half left when all of his are dead!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9965</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If Lord Tywin wants my help, he can bloody well ask for it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9966</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I am asking for your help, my lord,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9967</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And my father and my brother and my lord husband and my sons are asking with my voice.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>9968</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Save your sweet words, my lady.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>9970</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Did you see her?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9971</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Sixteen she is, a little flower, and her honey&apos;s only for me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9972</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I wager she gives me a son by this time next year.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9973</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Perhaps I&apos;ll make him heir, wouldn&apos;t that boil the rest of them?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9974</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m certain she will give you many sons.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>9975</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I was speaking of your sister.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9976</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I proposed that Lord and Lady Arryn foster two of my grandsons at court, and offered to take their own son to ward here at the Twins.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9977</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Are my grandsons unworthy to be seen at the king&apos;s court?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9978</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They are sweet boys, quiet and mannerly.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9979</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Walder is Merrett&apos;s son, named after me, and the other oneâ€¦ heh, I don&apos;t recallâ€¦ he might have been another Walder, they&apos;re always naming them Walder so I&apos;ll favor them, but his fatherâ€¦ which one was his father now?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9980</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well, whoever he was, Lord Arryn wouldn&apos;t have him, or the other one, and I blame your lady sister for that.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9981</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She frosted up as if I&apos;d suggested selling her boy to a mummer&apos;s show or making a eunuch out of him, and when Lord Arryn said the child was going to Dragonstone to foster with Stannis Baratheon, she stormed off without a word of regrets and all the Hand could give me was apologies.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9982</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What good are apologies?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9983</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I ask you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9984</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I had understood that Lysa&apos;s boy was to be fostered with Lord Tywin at Casterly Rock.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9985</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No, it was Lord Stannis,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9986</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do you think I can&apos;t tell Lord Stannis from Lord Tywin?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9987</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They&apos;re both bungholes who think they&apos;re too noble to shit, but never mind about that, I know the difference.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9988</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Or do you think I&apos;m so old I can&apos;t remember?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9989</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m ninety and I remember very well.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9990</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I remember what to do with a woman too.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9991</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That wife of mine will give me a son before this time next year, I&apos;ll wager.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9992</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Or a daughter, that can&apos;t be helped.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9993</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Boy or girl, it will be red, wrinkled, and squalling, and like as not she&apos;ll want to name it Walder or Walda.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9994</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Jon Arryn was going to foster his son with Lord Stannis, you are quite certain of that?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9995</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes, yes, yes,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9996</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Only he died, so what does it matter?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9997</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You say you want to cross the river?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9998</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We do.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9999</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well, you can&apos;t!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>Not unless I allow it, and why should I?</quotetext>

		<quotetext>The Tullys and the Starks have never been friends of mine.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>10002</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s done,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10003</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Walder will grant you your crossing.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10004</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>His swords are yours as well, less four hundred he means to keep back to hold the Twins.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10005</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I suggest that you leave four hundred of your own, a mixed force of archers and swordsmen.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10006</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He can scarcely object to an offer to augment his garrisonâ€¦ but make certain you give the command to a man you can trust.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10007</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Walder may need help keeping faith.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10008</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>As you say, Mother,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10009</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Perhapsâ€¦ Ser Helman Tallhart, do you think?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10010</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A fine choice.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10011</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Whatâ€¦ what did he want of us?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10012</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If you can spare a few of your swords, I need some men to escort two of Lord Frey&apos;s grandsons north to Winterfell,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10013</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have agreed to take them as wards.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10014</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They are young boys, aged eight years and seven.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10015</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It would seem they are both named Walder.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10016</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your brother Bran will welcome the companionship of lads near his own age, I should think.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10017</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Is that all?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10018</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Two fosterlings?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10019</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That&apos;s a small enough price toâ€”</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10020</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Frey&apos;s son Olyvar will be coming with us,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10021</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He is to serve as your personal squire.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10022</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>His father would like to see him knighted, in good time.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10023</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A squire.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10024</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Fine, that&apos;s fine, if he&apos;sâ€”</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10025</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Also, if your sister Arya is returned to us safely, it is agreed that she will marry Lord Walder&apos;s youngest son, Elmar, when the two of them come of age.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10026</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Arya won&apos;t like that one bit.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10027</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And you are to wed one of his daughters, once the fighting is done,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10028</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>His lordship has graciously consented to allow you to choose whichever girl you prefer.</quotetext>

	</quote>
	<quote>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10034</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I consent,</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>10040</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A dead man tried to kill me.</quotetext>

	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>You do not look well.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10043</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How is your hand?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10044</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Healing.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10045</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The maester says I&apos;ll have scars, but otherwise the hand should be as good as it was before.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>10046</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A scarred hand is nothing.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Dywen and Hake returned last night,</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10050</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They found no sign of your uncle, no more than the others did.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>10051</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I know.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>10052</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You know,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10053</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How is it that everyone knows everything around here?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10054</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It would seem there were only the two ofâ€¦ of those creatures, whatever they were, I will not call them men.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10055</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And thank the gods for that.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10056</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Any more andâ€¦ well, that doesn&apos;t bear thinking of.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10057</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There will be more, though.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10058</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I can feel it in these old bones of mine, and Maester Aemon agrees.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>The cold winds are rising.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>My lord,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10062</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>it&apos;s said there was a bird last nightâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10063</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There was.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10064</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What of it?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10065</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I had hoped for some word of my father.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10066</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Father,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10067</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Father.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>10068</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Grief and noise,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10069</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That&apos;s all they&apos;re good for, ravens.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10070</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why I put up with that pestilential birdâ€¦ if there was news of Lord Eddard, don&apos;t you think I would have sent for you?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10071</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Bastard or no, you&apos;re still his blood.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10072</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The message concerned Ser Barristan Selmy.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10073</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It seems he&apos;s been removed from the Kingsguard.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10074</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They gave his place to that black dog Clegane, and now Selmy&apos;s wanted for treason.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10075</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The fools sent some watchmen to seize him, but he slew two of them and escaped.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>10076</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We have white shadows in the woods and unquiet dead stalking our halls, and a boy sits the Iron Throne,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Boy, boy, boy, boy.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10078</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What of my sisters?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10079</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The message made no mention of Lord Eddard or the girls.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10080</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Perhaps they never got my letter.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10081</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Aemon sent two copies, with his best birds, but who can say?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10082</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>More like, Pycelle did not deign to reply.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>It would not be the first time, nor the last.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>I fear we count for less than nothing in King&apos;s Landing.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>They tell us what they want us to know, and that&apos;s little enough.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Corn,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Soon,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Well, dry leather and old wood, what could you expect?</quotetext>

		<quotetext>My sister returned it to my keeping, but the very sight of it reminded me of Jorah&apos;s shame, so I put it aside and thought no more of it until we found it in the ashes of my bedchamber.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>10111</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The original pommel was a bear&apos;s head, silver, yet so worn its features were all but indistinguishable.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>It did, once.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Claw,</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10136</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Claw.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10137</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Longclaw is an apt name.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Why?</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>Because I sent him, why do you think?</quotetext>

		<quotetext>I have commanded him to take ship to King&apos;s Landing and lay it before this boy king.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10152</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That should get young Joffrey&apos;s attention, I&apos;d thinkâ€¦ and Ser Alliser&apos;s a knight, highborn, anointed, with old friends at court, altogether harder to ignore than a glorified crow.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10153</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Crow.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>As well,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10155</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>it puts a thousand leagues twixt him and you without it seeming a rebuke.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10156</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And don&apos;t think this means I approve of that nonsense in the common hall.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>10168</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And tell Hobb that if he sends me boiled mutton again I&apos;m like to boil him.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Well, come about, let&apos;s have a look.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10176</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>At what?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10177</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your rosy butt cheeks, what else?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>The sword,</quotetext>

	<quote>

		<quotetext>We&apos;re not all as dumb as Grenn.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>I helped Pate carve the stone for the pommel,</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>10185</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>and your friend Sam bought the garnets in Mole&apos;s Town.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>10191</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Valyrian steel,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10192</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I heard of a man who had a razor made of Valyrian steel,</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>10193</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He cut his head off trying to shave.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>The Night&apos;s Watch is thousands of years old,</quotetext>

	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10196</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I need to see Hobb about the Old Bear&apos;s supper,</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>10203</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do you want to see the sword?</quotetext>

	<quote>

		<quotetext>It was Valyrian steel, beautiful but so sharp I was afraid I&apos;d hurt one of my sisters.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Dickon will have it now.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10210</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10211</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You told him, didn&apos;t you?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10212</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You told him that you told me.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>10213</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Iâ€¦ heâ€¦ Jon, I didn&apos;t want toâ€¦ he askedâ€¦ I mean I think he knew, he sees things no one else seesâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10214</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He&apos;s blind,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10215</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I can find the way myself.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10216</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Sam said you wanted me?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10217</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I did indeed.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10218</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Clydas, give Jon the bucket.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10219</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Perhaps he will be kind enough to assist me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10220</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Toss the meat into the cages,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Lord Mormont&apos;s raven likes fruit and corn.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10222</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He is a rare bird,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10223</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Most ravens will eat grain, but they prefer flesh.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10224</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It makes them strong, and I fear they relish the taste of blood.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10225</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>In that they are like menâ€¦ and like men, not all ravens are alike.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10226</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Doves and pigeons can also be trained to carry messages,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10227</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>though the raven is a stronger flyer, larger, bolder, far more clever, better able to defend itself against hawksâ€¦ yet ravens are black, and they eat the dead, so some godly men abhor them.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10228</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Baelor the Blessed tried to replace all the ravens with doves, did you know?</quotetext>

	<quote>

		<quotetext>The Night&apos;s Watch prefers ravens.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Dywen says the wildlings call us crows,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10231</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The crow is the raven&apos;s poor cousin.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10232</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They are both beggars in black, hated and misunderstood.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>10233</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Jon, did you ever wonder why the men of the Night&apos;s Watch take no wives and father no children?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10234</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10235</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So they will not love,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10236</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>for love is the bane of honor, the death of duty.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10237</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Tell me, Jon, if the day should ever come when your lord father must needs choose between honor on the one hand and those he loves on the other, what would he do?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10238</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He would do whatever was right,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10239</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No matter what.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10240</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A craven can be as brave as any man, when there is nothing to fear.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10241</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And we all do our duty, when there is no cost to it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10242</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How easy it seems then, to walk the path of honor.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10243</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yet soon or late in every man&apos;s life comes a day when it is not easy, a day when he must choose.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10244</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And this is my dayâ€¦ is that what you&apos;re saying?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10245</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It hurts, boy,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10246</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, yes.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10247</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Choosingâ€¦ it has always hurt.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10248</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And always will.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10249</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I know.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10250</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You don&apos;t know,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10251</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No one knows.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>Have you heard nothing I&apos;ve told you, Jon?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10254</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do you think you are the first?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10255</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Three times the gods saw fit to test my vows.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10256</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Once when I was a boy, once in the fullness of my manhood, and once when I had grown old.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10257</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>By then my strength was fled, my eyes grown dim, yet that last choice was as cruel as the first.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10258</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My ravens would bring the news from the south, words darker than their wings, the ruin of my House, the death of my kin, disgrace and desolation.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10259</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What could I have done, old, blind, frail?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10260</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I was helpless as a suckling babe, yet still it grieved me to sit forgotten as they cut down my brother&apos;s poor grandson, and his son, and even the little childrenâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10261</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Who are you?</quotetext>

		<quotetext>A moonsinger of the Jogos Nhai gifted me with her birthing songs, a woman of your own riding people taught me the magics of grass and corn and horse, and a maester from the Sunset Lands opened a body for me and showed me all the secrets that hide beneath the skin.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10630</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Once he was fully committed, Ser Kevan&apos;s pikes would wheel and take him in the flank, driving him into the river while I brought up the reserve.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10631</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And you thought it best to place me in the midst of this carnage, yet keep me ignorant of your plans.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>10632</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A feigned rout is less convincing,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Twelve thousand foot, scattered around the castle in three separate camps, with the rivers between,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>There is no other way to besiege Riverrun, yet still, that will be their undoing.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>He is no man for sitting in a tent while his carpenters build siege towers,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>No one can fault Lannister on his courage,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10723</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>When he saw that he was lost, he rallied his retainers and fought his way up the valley, hoping to reach Lord Robb and cut him down.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10724</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And almost did.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10725</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He mislaid his sword in Eddard Karstark&apos;s neck, after he took Torrhen&apos;s hand off and split Daryn Hornwood&apos;s skull open,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>10726</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>All the time he was shouting for me.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>If they hadn&apos;t tried to stop himâ€”</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>Your men did what they were sworn to do, Robb.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>We have won a battle, not a war.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>I vow, the Lannisters lost ten men for every one of ours that fell.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>10741</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Westerling, Lord Banefort, Ser Garth Greenfield, Lord Estren, Ser Tytos Brax, Mallor the Dornishmanâ€¦ and three Lannisters besides Jaime, Lord Tywin&apos;s own nephews, two of his sister&apos;s sons and one of his dead brother&apos;sâ€¦</quotetext>

	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11085</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your lord father took the cream of his guard to King&apos;s Landing, and your brother took the rest, along with all the likely lads for leagues around.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11086</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Many will not come back to us, and we must needs find the men to take their places.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>11087</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If I still had my legs, I could beat them all.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Ser Rodrik should teach me to use a poleaxe.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>11090</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We could be a knight together.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>11092</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Bran, when a man fights, his arms and legs and thoughts must be as one.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>11093</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You fight like a goose.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>11104</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Old Nan told me about him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11105</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He had a long staff with blades at both ends and he could spin it in his hands and chop two men at once.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Symeon Star-Eyes,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>When he lost his eyes, he put star sapphires in the empty sockets, or so the singers claim.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Bran, that is only a story, like the tales of Florian the Fool.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>I dreamed about the crow again last night.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11112</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The one with three eyes.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11113</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He flew into my bedchamber and told me to come with him, so I did.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11114</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We went down to the crypts.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11115</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Father was there, and we talked.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11116</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He was sad.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11117</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And why was that?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11118</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It was something to do about Jon, I think.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11119</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Hodor won&apos;t go down into the crypts.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11120</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Hodor won&apos;tâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11121</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Go down into the crypts.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11122</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>When I woke, I told him to take me down, to see if Father was truly there.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11123</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>At first he didn&apos;t know what I was saying, but I got him to the steps by telling him to go here and go there, only then he wouldn&apos;t go down.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11124</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He just stood on the top step and said â€˜Hodor,â€™ like he was scared of the dark, but I had a torch.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11125</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It made me so mad I almost gave him a swat in the head, like Old Nan is always doing.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11126</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I didn&apos;t, though.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11127</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Good.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11128</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Hodor is a man, not a mule to be beaten.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11129</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>In the dream I flew down with the crow, but I can&apos;t do that when I&apos;m awake,</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11130</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why would you want to go down to the crypts?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11131</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I told you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11132</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>To look for Father.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11133</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Bran, sweet child, one day Lord Eddard will sit below in stone, beside his father and his father&apos;s father and all the Starks back to the old Kings in the Northâ€¦ but that will not be for many years, gods be good.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>You will not find him in the crypts.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>He was there last night.</quotetext>

	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11139</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Would you like to go see?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11140</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I can&apos;t.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11141</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Hodor won&apos;t go, and the steps are too narrow and twisty for Dancer.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11142</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I believe I can solve that difficulty.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11143</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I lived my life beyond the Wall, a hole in the ground won&apos;t fret me none, m&apos;lords,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Summer, come,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11145</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Grim folk, by the look of them,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11146</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They were the Kings of Winter,</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>11147</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Winter&apos;s got no king.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>They were the Kings in the North for thousands of years,</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>11150</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Hard men for a hard time.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>11154</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That one is Jon Stark.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11155</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>When the sea raiders landed in the east, he drove them out and built the castle at White Harbor.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11156</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>His son was Rickard Stark, not my father&apos;s father but another Rickard, he took the Neck away from the Marsh King and married his daughter.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11157</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Theon Stark&apos;s the real thin one with the long hair and the skinny beard.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11158</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They called him the â€˜Hungry Wolf,â€™ because he was always at war.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11159</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That&apos;s a Brandon, the tall one with the dreamy face, he was Brandon the Shipwright, because he loved the sea.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11160</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>His tomb is empty.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11161</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He tried to sail west across the Sunset Sea and was never seen again.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11162</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>His son was Brandon the Burner, because he put the torch to all his father&apos;s ships in grief.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11163</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There&apos;s Rodrik Stark, who won Bear Island in a wrestling match and gave it to the Mormonts.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11164</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And that&apos;s Torrhen Stark, the King Who Knelt.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11165</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He was the last King in the North and the first Lord of Winterfell, after he yielded to Aegon the Conqueror.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11166</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, there, he&apos;s Cregan Stark.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11167</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He fought with Prince Aemon once, and the Dragonknight said he&apos;d never faced a finer swordsman.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11168</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And there&apos;s my grandfather, Lord Rickard, who was beheaded by Mad King Aerys.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11169</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>His daughter Lyanna and his son Brandon are in the tombs beside him.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>11170</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Not me, another Brandon, my father&apos;s brother.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11171</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They&apos;re not supposed to have statues, that&apos;s only for the lords and the kings, but my father loved them so much he had them done.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>The maid&apos;s a fair one,</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11173</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Robert was betrothed to marry her, but Prince Rhaegar carried her off and raped her,</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11174</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Robert fought a war to win her back.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11175</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He killed Rhaegar on the Trident with his hammer, but Lyanna died and he never got her back at all.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11176</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A sad tale,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>They were people of the Dawn Age, the very first, before kings and kingdoms,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11273</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Pact began four thousand years of friendship between men and children.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11274</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>In time, the First Men even put aside the gods they had brought with them, and took up the worship of the secret gods of the wood.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11275</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The signing of the Pact ended the Dawn Age, and began the Age of Heroes.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11276</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But the children of the forest are all gone now, you said.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11277</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Here, they are,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11278</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>North of the Wall, things are different.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11279</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That&apos;s where the children went, and the giants, and the other old races.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>11280</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Woman, by rights you ought to be dead or in chains.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Tell me where they went,</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>The Andals were the first, a race of tall, fair-haired warriors who came with steel and fire and the seven-pointed star of the new gods painted on their chests.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11288</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The wars lasted hundreds of years, but in the end the six southron kingdoms all fell before them.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11289</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Only here, where the King in the North threw back every army that tried to cross the Neck, did the rule of the First Men endure.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11290</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Andals burnt out the weirwood groves, hacked down the faces, slaughtered the children where they found them, and everywhere proclaimed the triumph of the Seven over the old gods.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11291</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So the children fled northâ€”</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>It&apos;s coming,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Why is he out here alone, in the sun?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11570</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He seems to like the warmth, Princess,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11571</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>His eyes follow the sun, though he does not see it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11572</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He can walk after a fashion.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11573</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He will go where you lead him, but no farther.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11574</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He will eat if you put food in his mouth, drink if you dribble water on his lips.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Your spells are costly, maegi.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>11576</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He lives,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11577</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You asked for life.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11578</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You paid for life.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11579</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This is not life, for one who was as Drogo was.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11580</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>His life was laughter, and meat roasting over a firepit, and a horse between his legs.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11581</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>His life was an arakh in his hand and his bells ringing in his hair as he rode to meet an enemy.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11582</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>His life was his bloodriders, and me, and the son I was to give him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11583</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>When will he be as he was?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11584</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11585</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>When the seas go dry and mountains blow in the wind like leaves.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>When your womb quickens again, and you bear a living child.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>11587</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Then he will return, and not before.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Leave us.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11589</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I would speak with this maegi alone.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11590</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You knew,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11591</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You knew what I was buying, and you knew the price, and yet you let me pay it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11592</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It was wrong of them to burn my temple,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11593</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That angered the Great Shepherd.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11594</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This was no god&apos;s work,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11595</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You cheated me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11596</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You murdered my child within me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11597</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The stallion who mounts the world will burn no cities now.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11598</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>His khalasar shall trample no nations into dust.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11599</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I spoke for you,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11600</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I saved you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11601</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Saved me?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11602</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Three riders had taken me, not as a man takes a woman but from behind, as a dog takes a bitch.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11603</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The fourth was in me when you rode past.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11604</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How then did you save me?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11605</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I saw my god&apos;s house burn, where I had healed good men beyond counting.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11606</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My home they burned as well, and in the street I saw piles of heads.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11607</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I saw the head of a baker who made my bread.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11608</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I saw the head of a boy I had saved from deadeye fever, only three moons past.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11609</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I heard children crying as the riders drove them off with their whips.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11610</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Tell me again what you saved.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11611</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your life.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11612</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Look to your khal and see what life is worth, when all the rest is gone.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11613</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Remember, Drogo,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11614</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Remember our first ride together, the day we wed.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11615</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Remember the night we made Rhaego, with the khalasar all around us and your eyes on my face.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11616</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Remember how cool and clean the water was in the Womb of the World.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11617</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Remember, my sun-and-stars.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11618</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Remember, and come back to me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11619</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11620</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>When the seas go dry and mountains blow in the wind like leaves.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11621</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>When my womb quickens again, and I bear a living child.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11622</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Then you will return, my sun-and-stars, and not before.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11623</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They have my son,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11624</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They do, my lord.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11625</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How could this happen?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11626</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11627</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Even after the Whispering Wood, you had Riverrun ringed in iron, surrounded by a great hostâ€¦ what madness made Ser Jaime decide to split his men into three separate camps?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11628</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Surely he knew how vulnerable that would leave them?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11629</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I would have done the same,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11630</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You have never seen Riverrun, Ser Harys, or you would know that Jaime had little choice in the matter.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11631</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The castle is situated at the end of the point of land where the Tumblestone flows into the Red Fork of the Trident.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11632</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The rivers form two sides of a triangle, and when danger threatens, the Tullys open their sluice gates upstream to create a wide moat on the third side, turning Riverrun into an island.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11633</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The walls rise sheer from the water, and from their towers the defenders have a commanding view of the opposite shores for many leagues around.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11634</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>To cut off all the approaches, a besieger must needs place one camp north of the Tumblestone, one south of the Red Fork, and a third between the rivers, west of the moat.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11635</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There is no other way, none.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11636</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ser Kevan speaks truly, my lords,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11637</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We&apos;d built palisades of sharpened stakes around the camps, yet it was not enough, not with no warning and the rivers cutting us off from each other.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11638</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They came down on the north camp first.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11639</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No one was expecting an attack.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11640</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Marq Piper had been raiding our supply trains, but he had no more than fifty men.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11641</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ser Jaime had gone out to deal with them the night beforeâ€¦ well, with what we thought was them.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11642</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We were told the Stark host was east of the Green Fork, marching southâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11643</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And your outriders?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11644</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They saw nothing?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11645</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They gave you no warning?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11646</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Our outriders had been vanishing.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11647</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Marq Piper&apos;s work, we thought.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11648</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The ones who did come back had seen nothing.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11649</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A man who sees nothing has no use for his eyes,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11650</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Cut them out and give them to your next outrider.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11651</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Tell him you hope that four eyes might see better than twoâ€¦ and if not, the man after him will have six.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11652</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You said they came at night,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11653</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Blackfish led the van, cutting down our sentries and clearing away the palisades for the main assault.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11654</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>By the time our men knew what was happening, riders were pouring over the ditch banks and galloping through the camp with swords and torches in hand.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11655</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I was sleeping in the west camp, between the rivers.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11656</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>When we heard the fighting and saw the tents being fired, Lord Brax led us to the rafts and we tried to pole across, but the current pushed us downstream and the Tullys started flinging rocks at us with the catapults on their walls.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11657</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I saw one raft smashed to kindling and three others overturned, men swept into the river and drownedâ€¦ and those who did make it across found the Starks waiting for them on the riverbanks.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11658</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My lord fatherâ€”</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11659</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Sorry, my lord,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11660</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Brax was clad in plate-and-mail when his raft overturned.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11661</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He was very gallant.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11662</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The camp between the rivers was overrun as well,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11663</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>While we were trying to cross, more Starks swept in from the west, two columns of armored horse.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11664</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I saw Lord Umber&apos;s giant-in-chains and the Mallister eagle, but it was the boy who led them, with a monstrous wolf running at his side.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11665</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I wasn&apos;t there to see, but it&apos;s said the beast killed four men and ripped apart a dozen horses.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11666</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Our spearmen formed up a shieldwall and held against their first charge, but when the Tullys saw them engaged, they opened the gates of Riverrun and Tytos Blackwood led a sortie across the drawbridge and took them in the rear.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11667</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Gods save us,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11668</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Greatjon Umber fired the siege towers we were building, and Lord Blackwood found Ser Edmure Tully in chains among the other captives, and made off with them all.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11669</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Our south camp was under the command of Ser Forley Prester.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11670</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He retreated in good order when he saw that the other camps were lost, with two thousand spears and as many bowmen, but the Tyroshi sellsword who led his freeriders struck his banners and went over to the foe.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11671</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Curse the man.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11672</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I warned Jaime not to trust that one.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11673</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A man who fights for coin is loyal only to his purse.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11674</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How could it happen?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11675</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ser Jaime taken, the siege brokenâ€¦ this is a catastrophe!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11676</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I am sure we are all grateful to you for pointing out the obvious, Ser Harys.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11677</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The question is, what shall we do about it?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11678</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What can we do?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11679</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Jaime&apos;s host is all slaughtered or taken or put to flight, and the Starks and the Tullys sit squarely across our line of supply.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11680</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We are cut off from the west!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11681</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They can march on Casterly Rock if they so choose, and what&apos;s to stop them?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11682</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My lords, we are beaten.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11683</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We must sue for peace.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11684</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Peace?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11685</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There&apos;s your peace, Ser Harys.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11686</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My sweet nephew broke it for good and all when he decided to ornament the Red Keep with Lord Eddard&apos;s head.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11687</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;ll have an easier time drinking wine from that cup than you will convincing Robb Stark to make peace now.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11688</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He&apos;s winningâ€¦ or hadn&apos;t you noticed?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11689</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Two battles do not make a war,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11690</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We are far from lost.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11691</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I should welcome the chance to try my own steel against this Stark boy.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11692</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Perhaps they would consent to a truce, and allow us to trade our prisoners for theirs,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11693</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Unless they trade three-for-one, we still come out light on those scales,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11694</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And what are we to offer for my brother?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11695</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Eddard&apos;s rotting head?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11696</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I had heard that Queen Cersei has the Hand&apos;s daughters,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11697</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If we give the lad his sisters backâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11698</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He would have to be an utter ass to trade Jaime Lannister&apos;s life for two girls.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11699</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Then we must ransom Ser Jaime, whatever it costs,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11700</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If the Starks feel the need for gold, they can melt down Jaime&apos;s armor.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11701</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>if we ask for a truce, they will think us weak,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11702</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We should march on them at once.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11703</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Surely our friends at court could be prevailed upon to join us with fresh troops,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11704</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And someone might return to Casterly Rock to raise a new host.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11705</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They have my son,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11706</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Leave me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11707</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>All of you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11708</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Not you, Tyrion.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11709</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Remain.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11710</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And you as well, Kevan.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11711</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The rest of you, out.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11712</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Uncle,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11713</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>if you would be so kindâ€”</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11714</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Here.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11715</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You have the right of it about Stark.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11716</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Alive, we might have used Lord Eddard to forge a peace with Winterfell and Riverrun, a peace that would have given us the time we need to deal with Robert&apos;s brothers.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>Our position is worse than you know,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>It would seem we have a new king.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>A newâ€”who?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>What have they done to Joffrey?</quotetext>

		<quotetext>My grandson still sits the Iron Throne, but the eunuch has heard whispers from the south.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>11729</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Renly Baratheon wed Margaery Tyrell at Highgarden this fortnight past, and now he has claimed the crown.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11730</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The bride&apos;s father and brothers have bent the knee and sworn him their swords.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11731</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Those are grave tidings.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>My daughter commands us to ride for King&apos;s Landing at once, to defend the Red Keep against King Renly and the Knight of Flowers.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11733</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Commands us, mind you.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>In the name of the king and council.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>How is King Joffrey taking the news?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11736</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Cersei has not seen fit to tell him yet,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11737</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She fears he might insist on marching against Renly himself.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>11738</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>With what army?</quotetext>

	<quote>

		<quotetext>You don&apos;t plan to give him this one, I hope?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11740</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He talks of leading the City Watch,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11741</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If he takes the Watch, he&apos;ll leave the city undefended,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11742</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And with Lord Stannis on Dragonstoneâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11743</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11744</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I had thought you were the one made for motley, Tyrion, but it would appear that I was wrong.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11745</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why, Father,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11746</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>that almost sounds like praise.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11747</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What of Stannis?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11748</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He&apos;s the elder, not Renly.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11749</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How does he feel about his brother&apos;s claim?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11750</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have felt from the beginning that Stannis was a greater danger than all the others combined.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11751</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yet he does nothing.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11752</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, Varys hears his whispers.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11753</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Stannis is building ships, Stannis is hiring sellswords, Stannis is bringing a shadowbinder from Asshai.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11754</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What does it mean?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>Kevan, bring us the map.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11757</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Jaime has left us in a bad way.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11758</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Roose Bolton and the remnants of his host are north of us.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11759</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Our enemies hold the Twins and Moat Cailin.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11760</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Robb Stark sits to the west, so we cannot retreat to Lannisport and the Rock unless we choose to give battle.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11761</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Jaime is taken, and his army for all purposes has ceased to exist.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>11762</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Thoros of Myr and Beric Dondarrion continue to plague our foraging parties.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11763</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>To our east we have the Arryns, Stannis Baratheon sits on Dragonstone, and in the south Highgarden and Storm&apos;s End are calling their banners.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11764</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Take heart, Father.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11765</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>At least Rhaegar Targaryen is still dead.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11766</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I had hoped you might have more to offer us than japes, Tyrion,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11767</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Robb Stark will have Edmure Tully and the lords of the Trident with him now.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11768</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Their combined power may exceed our own.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11769</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And with Roose Bolton behind usâ€¦ Tywin, if we remain here, I fear we might be caught between three armies.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11770</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have no intention of remaining here.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11771</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We must finish our business with young Lord Stark before Renly Baratheon can march from Highgarden.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11772</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Bolton does not concern me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11773</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He is a wary man, and we made him warier on the Green Fork.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11774</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He will be slow to give pursuit.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11775</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Soâ€¦ on the morrow, we make for Harrenhal.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11776</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Kevan, I want Ser Addam&apos;s outriders to screen our movements.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11777</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Give him as many men as he requires, and send them out in groups of four.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11778</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I will have no vanishings.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11779</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>As you say, my lord, butâ€¦ why Harrenhal?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11780</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That is a grim, unlucky place.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11781</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Some call it cursed.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11782</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Let them,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11783</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Unleash Ser Gregor and send him before us with his reavers.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11784</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Send forth Vargo Hoat and his freeriders as well, and Ser Amory Lorch.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11785</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Each is to have three hundred horse.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11786</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Tell them I want to see the riverlands afire from the Gods Eye to the Red Fork.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11787</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They will burn, my lord,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11788</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I shall give the commands.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11789</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your savages might relish a bit of rapine.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11790</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Tell them they may ride with Vargo Hoat and plunder as they likeâ€”goods, stock, women, they may take what they want and burn the rest.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11791</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Telling Shagga and Timett how to pillage is like telling a rooster how to crow,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11792</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>but I should prefer to keep them with me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11793</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Then you had best learn to control them.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11794</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I will not have the city plundered.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11795</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The city?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11796</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What city would that be?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11797</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>King&apos;s Landing.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11798</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I am sending you to court.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11799</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And what am I to do there?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11800</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Rule,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11801</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My sweet sister might have a word or two to say about that!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11802</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Let her say what she likes.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11803</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Her son needs to be taken in hand before he ruins us all.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11804</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I blame those jackanapes on the councilâ€”our friend Petyr, the venerable Grand Maester, and that cockless wonder Lord Varys.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11805</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What sort of counsel are they giving Joffrey when he lurches from one folly to the next?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11806</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Whose notion was it to make this Janos Slynt a lord?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11807</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The man&apos;s father was a butcher, and they grant him Harrenhal.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11808</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Harrenhal, that was the seat of kings!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11809</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Not that he will ever set foot inside it, if I have a say.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11810</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I am told he took a bloody spear for his sigil.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11811</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A bloody cleaver would have been my choice.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11812</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And dismissing Selmy, where was the sense in that?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11813</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes, the man was old, but the name of Barristan the Bold still has meaning in the realm.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11814</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He lent honor to any man he served.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11815</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Can anyone say the same of the Hound?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11816</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You feed your dog bones under the table, you do not seat him beside you on the high bench.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11817</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If Cersei cannot curb the boy, you must.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11818</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And if these councillors are playing us falseâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11819</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Spikes,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11820</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Heads.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>11821</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Walls.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11822</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I see you have taken a few lessons from me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11823</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>More than you know, Father,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11824</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why me?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11825</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why not my uncle?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>Why not Ser Addam or Ser Flement or Lord Serrett?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>Why not aâ€¦ bigger man?</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>11828</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You are my son.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11829</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>One last thing,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11830</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You will not take the whore to court.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11831</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>M&apos;lord,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11832</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have a mind to take you to King&apos;s Landing, sweetling,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11833</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Easy, sweet lady,</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>Jon, please.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11837</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You must not do this.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>Get out of my way, Sam.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>Jon, you can&apos;t,</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>11840</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I won&apos;t let you.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>11841</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I would sooner not hurt you,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11842</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Move aside, Sam, or I&apos;ll ride you down.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11843</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You won&apos;t.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>Pleaseâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11846</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I warned him,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11847</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It was nothing to do with him, anyway.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11848</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You said the words,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11849</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You took a vow, before your brothers, before the old gods and the new.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11850</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>buried treasures.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11857</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ouiet now,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11858</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>â€¦certain he came this way?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11859</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We can&apos;t be certain.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11860</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He could have ridden east, for all you know.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11861</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Or left the road to cut through the woods.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11862</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That&apos;s what I&apos;d do.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>In the dark?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11864</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Stupid.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11865</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If you didn&apos;t fall off your horse and break your neck, you&apos;d get lost and wind up back at the Wall when the sun came up.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11866</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I would not.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>11867</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;d just ride south, you can tell south by the stars.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>What if the sky was cloudy?</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>Keep quiet, all of you,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>He forbade it.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12062</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He did not want his enemies to know that he was dying.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12063</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>With the realm so troubled, he feared that if the Lannisters suspected how frail he wasâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12064</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>â€¦they might attack?</quotetext>

		<quotetext>The Lannisters must have thought the Others themselves were on them when that wolf of Robb&apos;s got in among them.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12175</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I saw him tear one man&apos;s arm from his shoulder, and their horses went mad at the scent of him.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>12181</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He did with me too,</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>12182</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I liked it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12183</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Mother,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12184</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We must call a council.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12185</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There are things to be decided.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12186</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your grandfather would like to see you,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Robb, he&apos;s very sick.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12188</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ser Edmure told me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12189</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I am sorry, Motherâ€¦ for Lord Hoster and for you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12190</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yet first we must meet.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12191</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We&apos;ve had word from the south.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12192</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Renly Baratheon has claimed his brother&apos;s crown.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12193</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Renly?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12194</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I had thought, surely it would be Lord Stannisâ€¦</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12195</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So did we all, my lady,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12196</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Renly is not the king,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12197</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You cannot mean to hold to Joffrey, my lord,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12198</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He put your father to death.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12199</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That makes him evil,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12200</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I do not know that it makes Renly king.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12201</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Joffrey is still Robert&apos;s eldest trueborn son, so the throne is rightfully his by all the laws of the realm.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12202</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Were he to die, and I mean to see that he does, he has a younger brother.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12203</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Tommen is next in line after Joffrey.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12204</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Tommen is no less a Lannister,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12205</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>As you say,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12206</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yet if neither one is king, still, how could it be Lord Renly?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12207</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He&apos;s Robert&apos;s younger brother.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>Bran can&apos;t be Lord of Winterfell before me, and Renly can&apos;t be king before Lord Stannis.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12209</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lord Stannis has the better claim.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12210</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Renly is crowned,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12211</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Highgarden and Storm&apos;s End support his claim, and the Dornishmen will not be laggardly.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12212</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If Winterfell and Riverrun add their strength to his, he will have five of the seven great houses behind him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12213</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Six, if the Arryns bestir themselves!</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>12215</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My lords, within the year, we will have all their heads on pikes, the queen and the boy king, Lord Tywin, the Imp, the Kingslayer, Ser Kevan, all of them!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12216</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That is what we shall win if we join with King Renly.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12217</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What does Lord Stannis have against that, that we should cast it all aside?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12218</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The right,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12219</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So you mean us to declare for Stannis?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12220</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I don&apos;t know,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12221</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I prayed to know what to do, but the gods did not answer.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12222</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Lannisters killed my father for a traitor, and we know that was a lie, but if Joffrey is the lawful king and we fight against him, we will be traitors.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12223</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My lord father would urge caution,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Wait, let these two kings play their game of thrones.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>12225</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>When they are done fighting, we can bend our knees to the victor, or oppose him, as we choose.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12226</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>With Renly arming, likely Lord Tywin would welcome a truceâ€¦ and the safe return of his son.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12227</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Noble lords, allow me to go to him at Harrenhal and arrange good terms and ransomsâ€¦</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>12228</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Craven!</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Begging for a truce will make us seem weak,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Ransoms be damned, we must not give up the Kingslayer,</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>Lord Eddard was your liege, but I shared his bed and bore his children.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12236</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do you think I love him any less than you?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12237</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Robb, if that sword could bring him back, I should never let you sheathe it until Ned stood at my side once moreâ€¦ but he is gone, and hundred Whispering Woods will not change that.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12238</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ned is gone, and Daryn Hornwood, and Lord Karstark&apos;s valiant sons, and many other good men besides, and none of them will return to us.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12239</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Must we have more deaths still?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12240</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You are a woman, my lady,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12241</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Women do not understand these things.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12242</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You are the gentle sex,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12243</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A man has a need for vengeance.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>Give me Cersei Lannister, Lord Karstark, and you would see how gentle a woman can be,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12245</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well, the one is done, and the other forever beyond our reach.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12246</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I will mourn for Ned until the end of my days, but I must think of the living.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12247</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I want my daughters back, and the queen holds them still.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>If I must trade our four Lannisters for their two Starks, I will call that a bargain and thank the gods.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>12249</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I want you safe, Robb, ruling at Winterfell from your father&apos;s seat.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12250</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I want you to live your life, to kiss a girl and wed a woman and father a son.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12251</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I want to write an end to this.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>Peace,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12254</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Peace is sweet, my ladyâ€¦ but on what terms?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12255</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It is no good hammering your sword into a plowshare if you must forge it again on the morrow.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12256</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What did Torrhen and my Eddard die for, if I am to return to Karhold with nothing but their bones?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12257</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Aye,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12258</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Gregor Clegane laid waste to my fields, slaughtered my smallfolk, and left Stone Hedge a smoking ruin.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12259</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Am I now to bend the knee to the ones who sent him?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12260</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What have we fought for, if we are to put all back as it was before?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12261</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And if we do make peace with King Joffrey, are we not then traitors to King Renly?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12262</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What if the stag should prevail against the lion, where would that leave us?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12263</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Whatever you may decide for yourselves, I shall never call a Lannister my king,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12264</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Nor I!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>Here is what I say to these two kings!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12268</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Renly Baratheon is nothing to me, nor Stannis neither.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12269</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why should they rule over me and mine, from some flowery seat in Highgarden or Dorne?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12270</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What do they know of the Wall or the wolfswood or the barrows of the First Men?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12271</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Even their gods are wrong.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12272</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Others take the Lannisters too, I&apos;ve had a bellyful of them.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12273</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why shouldn&apos;t we rule ourselves again?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12274</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It was the dragons we married, and the dragons are all dead!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12275</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There sits the only king I mean to bow my knee to, m&apos;lords,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12276</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The King in the North!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12277</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ll have peace on those terms,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12278</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They can keep their red castle and their iron chair as well.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12279</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The King in the North!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12280</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The King of Winter!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>It is not enough to kill a horse,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12285</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>By itself, the blood is nothing.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12286</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You do not have the words to make a spell, nor the wisdom to find them.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>12287</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do you think bloodmagic is a game for children?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12288</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You call me maegi as if it were a curse, but all it means is wise.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12289</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You are a child, with a child&apos;s ignorance.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>Whatever you mean to do, it will not work.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Loose me from these bonds and I will help you.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>I am tired of the maegi&apos;s braying,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Those are mine,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Princessâ€¦</quotetext>

	<quote>

		<quotetext>My brother Viserys was your king, was he not?</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>12298</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He was, my lady.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Jhogo, to you I give the silver-handled whip that was my bride gift, and name you ko, and ask your oath, that you will live and die as blood of my blood, riding at my side to keep me safe from harm.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>this is not done.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Rakharo,</quotetext>
