		<quote>In peace the title is only an honor</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>644</quoteindex>
		<quote>Let the boy keep it</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>645</quoteindex>
		<quote>For his father’s sake if not his own</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>646</quoteindex>
		<quote>Surely you owe Jon that much for his service</quote>

		<quote>I am not ungrateful Ned</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quote>You of all men ought to know that</quote>

	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>652</quoteindex>

	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>653</quoteindex>

	</quote>
	<quote>

	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>676</quoteindex>
		<quote>Perhaps that is why the Starks have so little humor</quote>

	</quote>

	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2898</quoteindex>
		<quote>How much</quote>

	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2910</quoteindex>
		<quote>I shall have to borrow the money</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2911</quoteindex>
		<quote>No doubt the Lannisters will be accommodating</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quote>Are you claiming that the Crown is three million gold pieces in debt</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quote>The Crown is more than six million gold pieces in debt Lord Stark</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2915</quoteindex>
		<quote>The Lannisters are the biggest part of it but we have also borrowed from Lord Tyrell the Iron Bank of Braavos and several Tyroshi trading cartels</quote>

	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3676</quoteindex>
		<quote>There came a night that lasted a generation and kings shivered and died in their castles even as the swineherds in their hovels</quote>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3677</quoteindex>
		<quote>Women smothered their children rather than see them starve and cried and felt their tears freeze on their cheeks</quote>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3682</quoteindex>
		<quote>In that darkness the Others came for the first time</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3683</quoteindex>
		<quote>They were cold things dead things that hated iron and fire and the touch of the sun and every creature with hot blood in its veins</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3684</quoteindex>
		<quote>They swept over holdfasts and cities and kingdoms felled heroes and armies by the score riding their pale dead horses and leading hosts of the slain</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3685</quoteindex>
		<quote>All the swords of men could not stay their advance and even maidens and suckling babes found no pity in them</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3686</quoteindex>
		<quote>They hunted the maids through frozen forests and fed their dead servants on the flesh of human children</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3687</quoteindex>
		<quote>Now these were the days before the Andals came and long before the women fled across the narrow sea from the cities of the Rhoyne and the hundred kingdoms of those times were the kingdoms of the First Men who had taken these lands from the children of the forest</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3688</quoteindex>
		<quote>Yet here and there in the fastness of the woods the children still lived in their wooden cities and hollow hills and the faces in the trees kept watch</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3689</quoteindex>
		<quote>So as cold and death filled the earth the last hero determined to seek out the children in the hopes that their ancient magics could win back what the armies of men had lost</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3690</quoteindex>
		<quote>He set out into the dead lands with a sword a horse a dog and a dozen companions</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3691</quoteindex>
		<quote>For years he searched until he despaired of ever finding the children of the forest in their secret cities</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3692</quoteindex>
		<quote>One by one his friends died and his horse and finally even his dog and his sword froze so hard the blade snapped when he tried to use it</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>3693</quoteindex>
		<quote>And the Others smelled the hot blood in him and came silent on his trail stalking him with packs of pale white spiders big as hounds—</quote>

	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4857</quoteindex>

		<quoteindex>4860</quoteindex>
		<quote>She asked him not to fight</quote>
	</quote>

		<quote>I ask you</quote>
	</quote>

		<quote>Even if he’d fought who would have dared to strike the king</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4865</quoteindex>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4870</quoteindex>
		<quote>So sad</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>4871</quoteindex>
		<quote>Yet no doubt the gracious and compassionate widow would take pity lift the poor unfortunate to his feet and bless him with a gentle kiss of forgiveness</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quote>Good King Joffrey would have no choice but to pardon him</quote>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6854</quoteindex>
		<quote>To ask that Samwell Tarly be taken from training and accepted as a brother of the Night’s Watch</quote>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6855</quoteindex>
		<quote>This is no concern of Maester Aemon</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6856</quoteindex>
		<quote>Our Lord Commander has given the training of recruits into the hands of Ser Alliser Thorne</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6857</quoteindex>
		<quote>Only he may say when a boy is ready to swear his vow as you surely know</quote>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6858</quoteindex>
		<quote>Why then come to me</quote>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>6859</quoteindex>
		<quote>The Lord Commander listens to you</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quote>And the wounded and the sick of the Night’s Watch are in your charge</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quote>And is your friend Samwell wounded or sick</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6862</quoteindex>
		<quote>He will be</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6863</quoteindex>
		<quote>unless you help</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6864</quoteindex>
		<quote>Without us to keep him safe Sam will have no chance</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6865</quoteindex>
		<quote>He’s hopeless with a sword</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6866</quoteindex>
		<quote>My sister Arya could tear him apart and she’s not yet ten</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6867</quoteindex>
		<quote>If Ser Alliser makes him fight it’s only a matter of time before he’s hurt or killed</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6868</quoteindex>
		<quote>I’ve seen this fat boy in the common hall</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quote>He is a pig and a hopeless craven as well if what you say is true</quote>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6870</quoteindex>
		<quote>Maybe it is so</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6871</quoteindex>
		<quote>Tell me Chett what would you have us do with such a boy</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6872</quoteindex>
		<quote>Leave him where he is</quote>
	</quote>

		<quote>The Wall is no place for the weak</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quote>Let him train until he is ready no matter how many years that takes</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6875</quoteindex>
		<quote>Ser Alliser shall make a man of him or kill him as the gods will</quote>

		<quote>That’s stupid</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6877</quoteindex>
		<quote>I remember once I asked Maester Luwin why he wore a chain around his throat</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6878</quoteindex>
		<quote>Go on</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6879</quoteindex>
		<quote>He told me that a maester’s collar is made of chain to remind him that he is sworn to serve</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6880</quoteindex>
		<quote>I asked why each link was a different metal</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6881</quoteindex>
		<quote>A silver chain would look much finer with his grey robes I said</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6882</quoteindex>
		<quote>Maester Luwin laughed</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6883</quoteindex>
		<quote>A maester forges his chain with study he told me</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6884</quoteindex>
		<quote>The different metals are each a different kind of learning gold for the study of money and accounts silver for healing iron for warcraft</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6885</quoteindex>
		<quote>And he said there were other meanings as well</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6886</quoteindex>
		<quote>The collar is supposed to remind a maester of the realm he serves isn’t that so</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6887</quoteindex>
		<quote>Lords are gold and knights steel but two links can’t make a chain</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6888</quoteindex>
		<quote>You also need silver and iron and lead tin and copper and bronze and all the rest and those are farmers and smiths and merchants and the like</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6889</quoteindex>
		<quote>A chain needs all sorts of metals and a land needs all sorts of people</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6890</quoteindex>
		<quote>And so</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6891</quoteindex>
		<quote>The Night’s Watch needs all sorts too</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quote>Why else have rangers and stewards and builders</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6893</quoteindex>
		<quote>Lord Randyll couldn’t make Sam a warrior and Ser Alliser won’t either</quote>
	</quote>

		<quote>You can’t hammer tin into iron no matter how hard you beat it but that doesn’t mean tin is useless</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6895</quoteindex>
		<quote>Why shouldn’t Sam be a steward</quote>

	<quote>

	<quote>

		<quote>We have no chance of fighting our way back</quote>

		<quote>I fear we might have forgotten that if you had not pointed it out</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7226</quoteindex>
		<quote>Ser Marq Ser Karyl Ser Raymun—perhaps I might ask you a question</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7227</quoteindex>
		<quote>These holdfasts were under your protection</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7228</quoteindex>
		<quote>Where were you when all this slaughtering and burning was going on</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7229</quoteindex>
		<quote>I was attending my lord father in the pass below the Golden Tooth as was Ser Marq</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7230</quoteindex>
		<quote>When the word of these outrages reached Ser Edmure Tully he sent word that we should take a small force of men to find what survivors we could and bring them to the king</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7231</quoteindex>
		<quote>Ser Edmure had summoned me to Riverrun with all my strength</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7232</quoteindex>
		<quote>I was camped across the river from his walls awaiting his commands when the word reached me</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7233</quoteindex>
		<quote>By the time I could return to my own lands Clegane and his vermin were back across the Red Fork riding for Lannister’s hills</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7234</quoteindex>
		<quote>And if they come again ser</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7235</quoteindex>
		<quote>If they come again we’ll use their blood to water the fields they burnt</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7236</quoteindex>
		<quote>Ser Edmure has sent men to every village and holdfast within a day’s ride of the border</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7237</quoteindex>
		<quote>The next raider will not have such an easy time of it</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7238</quoteindex>
		<quote>If your fields and holdfasts are safe from harm</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7239</quoteindex>
		<quote>what then do you ask of the throne</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7240</quoteindex>
		<quote>The lords of the Trident keep the king’s peace</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7241</quoteindex>
		<quote>The Lannisters have broken it</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7242</quoteindex>
		<quote>We ask leave to answer them steel for steel</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7243</quoteindex>
		<quote>We ask justice for the smallfolk of Sherrer and Wendish Town and the Mummer’s Ford</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7244</quoteindex>
		<quote>Edmure agrees we must pay Gregor Clegane back his bloody coin</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7245</quoteindex>
		<quote>but old Lord Hoster commanded us to come here and beg the king’s leave before we strike</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7246</quoteindex>
		<quote>My lord Hand if these good folk believe that Ser Gregor has forsaken his holy vows for plunder and rape let them go to his liege lord and make their complaint</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7247</quoteindex>
		<quote>These crimes are no concern of the throne</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7248</quoteindex>
		<quote>Let them seek Lord Tywin’s justice</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7249</quoteindex>
		<quote>It is all the king’s justice</quote>
	</quote>

		<quote>North south east or west all we do we do in Robert’s name</quote>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7251</quoteindex>
		<quote>The king’s justice</quote>
	</quote>

	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quote>The king is hunting across the river and may not return for days</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quote>Robert bid me to sit here in his place to listen with his ears and to speak with his voice</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quote>Vengeance</quote>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>7263</quoteindex>
		<quote>I thought we were speaking of justice</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7264</quoteindex>
		<quote>Burning Clegane’s fields and slaughtering his people will not restore the king’s peace only your injured pride</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7265</quoteindex>
		<quote>People of Sherrer I cannot give you back your homes or your crops nor can I restore your dead to life</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7266</quoteindex>
		<quote>But perhaps I can give you some small measure of justice in the name of our king Robert</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7267</quoteindex>
		<quote>The First Men believed that the judge who called for death should wield the sword and in the north we hold to that still</quote>

		<quote>In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon the First of his Name King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm by the word of Eddard of the House Stark his Hand I charge you to ride to the westlands with all haste to cross the Red Fork of the Trident under the king’s flag and there bring the king’s justice to the false knight Gregor Clegane and to all those who shared in his crimes</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>

	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quote>Had it been me up there I should have sent Ser Loras</quote>
	</quote>

		<quote>He so wanted to go… and a man who has the Lannisters for his enemies would do well to make the Tyrells his friends</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7295</quoteindex>
		<quote>Ser Loras is young</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7296</quoteindex>
		<quote>I daresay he will outgrow the disappointment</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7298</quoteindex>
		<quote>He is the King’s Justice after all</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>7300</quoteindex>
		<quote>No slight was intended</quote>

		<quote>I remind you the Paynes are bannermen to House Lannister</quote>

		<quote>Very prudent no doubt</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>

	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8466</quoteindex>
		<quote>And yet the moment the king was dead he called the small council together to steal Prince Joffrey’s rightful throne</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8467</quoteindex>
		<quote>No</quote>
	</quote>

		<quote>Please Your Grace there’s been a mistake</quote>

		<quoteindex>8474</quoteindex>
		<quote>Robert thought so</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>

	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>8483</quoteindex>
		<quote>It was for love</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>

	<quote>

	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9224</quoteindex>
		<quote>So long as you have power enough that they must fear you Ned and your sister should be safe</quote>

	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9234</quoteindex>
		<quote>Less than a fortnight past they fought a battle in the hills below the Golden Tooth</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9235</quoteindex>
		<quote>Father must have known that because he sent out some men to oppose them under the king’s own banner</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9236</quoteindex>
		<quote>He gave the command to some southron lordling Lord Erik or Derik or something like that but Ser Raymun Darry rode with him and the letter said there were other knights as well and a force of Father’s own guardsmen</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9237</quoteindex>
		<quote>Only it was a trap</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9238</quoteindex>
		<quote>Lord Derik had no sooner crossed the Red Fork than the Lannisters fell upon him the king’s banner be damned and Gregor Clegane took them in the rear as they tried to pull back across the Mummer’s Ford</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9239</quoteindex>
		<quote>This Lord Derik and a few others may have escaped no one is certain but Ser Raymun was killed and most of our men from Winterfell</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9240</quoteindex>
		<quote>Lord Tywin has closed off the kingsroad it’s said and now he’s marching north toward Harrenhal burning as he goes</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9241</quoteindex>
		<quote>You mean to meet him here</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9242</quoteindex>
		<quote>If he comes so far but no one thinks he will</quote>

		<quote>I’ve sent word to Howland Reed Father’s old friend at Greywater Watch</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9244</quoteindex>
		<quote>If the Lannisters come up the Neck the crannogmen will bleed them every step of the way but Galbart Glover says Lord Tywin is too smart for that and Roose Bolton agrees</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9245</quoteindex>
		<quote>He’ll stay close to the Trident they believe taking the castles of the river lords one by one until Riverrun stands alone</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9246</quoteindex>
		<quote>We need to march south to meet him</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9247</quoteindex>
		<quote>Is that wise</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quote>It’s said that the old Kings in the North could stand at Moat Cailin and throw back hosts ten times the size of their own</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9250</quoteindex>
		<quote>Yes but our food and supplies are running low and this is not land we can live off easily</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9251</quoteindex>
		<quote>We’ve been waiting for Lord Manderly but now that his sons have joined us we need to march</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9252</quoteindex>
		<quote>Marching is all very well</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9253</quoteindex>
		<quote>but where and to what purpose</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9254</quoteindex>
		<quote>What do you mean to do</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9255</quoteindex>
		<quote>The Greatjon thinks we should take the battle to Lord Tywin and surprise him</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9256</quoteindex>
		<quote>but the Glovers and the Karstarks feel we’d be wiser to go around his army and join up with Uncle Ser Edmure against the Kingslayer</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9257</quoteindex>
		<quote>Though by the time we reach Riverrun… I’m not certain…</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9258</quoteindex>
		<quote>Be certain</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9259</quoteindex>
		<quote>or go home and take up that wooden sword again</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9260</quoteindex>
		<quote>You cannot afford to seem indecisive in front of men like Roose Bolton and Rickard Karstark</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9261</quoteindex>
		<quote>Make no mistake Robb—these are your bannermen not your friends</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quote>You named yourself battle commander</quote>

	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9264</quoteindex>
		<quote>As you say Mother</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9265</quoteindex>
		<quote>I’ll ask you again</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9266</quoteindex>
		<quote>What do you mean to do</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9267</quoteindex>
		<quote>Both plans have virtues but… look if we try to swing around Lord Tywin’s host we take the risk of being caught between him and the Kingslayer and if we attack him… by all reports he has more men than I do and a lot more armored horse</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9268</quoteindex>
		<quote>The Greatjon says that won’t matter if we catch him with his breeches down but it seems to me that a man who has fought as many battles as Tywin Lannister won’t be so easily surprised</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9269</quoteindex>
		<quote>Good</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9270</quoteindex>
		<quote>Tell me more</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9271</quoteindex>
		<quote>I’d leave a small force here to hold Moat Cailin archers mostly and march the rest down the causeway</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9272</quoteindex>
		<quote>but once we’re below the Neck I’d split our host in two</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9273</quoteindex>
		<quote>The foot can continue down the kingsroad while our horsemen cross the Green Fork at the Twins</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9274</quoteindex>
		<quote>When Lord Tywin gets word that we’ve come south he’ll march north to engage our main host leaving our riders free to hurry down the west bank to Riverrun</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9275</quoteindex>
		<quote>You’d put a river between the two parts of your army</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9276</quoteindex>
		<quote>And between Jaime and Lord Tywin</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9277</quoteindex>
		<quote>There’s no crossing on the Green Fork above the ruby ford where Robert won his crown</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9278</quoteindex>
		<quote>Not until the Twins all the way up here and Lord Frey controls that bridge</quote>

	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9288</quoteindex>
		<quote>The Greatjon is always saying that we should smash Lord Tywin</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9289</quoteindex>
		<quote>I thought I’d give him the honor</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9290</quoteindex>
		<quote>Your father once told me that the Greatjon was as fearless as any man he had ever known</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9291</quoteindex>
		<quote>Grey Wind ate two of his fingers and he laughed about it</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9292</quoteindex>
		<quote>So you agree then</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9293</quoteindex>
		<quote>Your father is not fearless</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9294</quoteindex>
		<quote>He is brave but that is very different</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9295</quoteindex>
		<quote>The eastern host will be all that stands between Lord Tywin and Winterfell</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9296</quoteindex>
		<quote>Well them and whatever few bowmen I leave here at the Moat</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>9297</quoteindex>

	</quote>
	<quote>

	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12194</quoteindex>
		<quote>We’ve had word from the south</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12195</quoteindex>
		<quote>Renly Baratheon has claimed his brother’s crown</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12196</quoteindex>
		<quote>Renly</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12197</quoteindex>
		<quote>I had thought surely it would be Lord Stannis…</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12198</quoteindex>
		<quote>So did we all my lady</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12199</quoteindex>
		<quote>Renly is not the king</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12200</quoteindex>
		<quote>You cannot mean to hold to Joffrey my lord</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12201</quoteindex>
		<quote>He put your father to death</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12202</quoteindex>
		<quote>That makes him evil</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12203</quoteindex>
		<quote>I do not know that it makes Renly king</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12204</quoteindex>
		<quote>Joffrey is still Robert’s eldest trueborn son so the throne is rightfully his by all the laws of the realm</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12205</quoteindex>
		<quote>Were he to die and I mean to see that he does he has a younger brother</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12206</quoteindex>
		<quote>Tommen is next in line after Joffrey</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12207</quoteindex>
		<quote>Tommen is no less a Lannister</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12208</quoteindex>
		<quote>As you say</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12209</quoteindex>
		<quote>Yet if neither one is king still how could it be Lord Renly</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12210</quoteindex>
		<quote>He’s Robert’s younger brother</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12211</quoteindex>
		<quote>Bran can’t be Lord of Winterfell before me and Renly can’t be king before Lord Stannis</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12212</quoteindex>
		<quote>Lord Stannis has the better claim</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12213</quoteindex>
		<quote>Renly is crowned</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12214</quoteindex>
		<quote>Highgarden and Storm’s End support his claim and the Dornishmen will not be laggardly</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12215</quoteindex>
		<quote>If Winterfell and Riverrun add their strength to his he will have five of the seven great houses behind him</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12216</quoteindex>
		<quote>Six if the Arryns bestir themselves</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12217</quoteindex>
		<quote>Six against the Rock</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12218</quoteindex>
		<quote>My lords within the year we will have all their heads on pikes the queen and the boy king Lord Tywin the Imp the Kingslayer Ser Kevan all of them</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12219</quoteindex>
		<quote>That is what we shall win if we join with King Renly</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12220</quoteindex>
		<quote>What does Lord Stannis have against that that we should cast it all aside</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12221</quoteindex>
		<quote>The right</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12222</quoteindex>
		<quote>So you mean us to declare for Stannis</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12223</quoteindex>
		<quote>I don’t know</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quote>I prayed to know what to do but the gods did not answer</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12225</quoteindex>
		<quote>The Lannisters killed my father for a traitor and we know that was a lie but if Joffrey is the lawful king and we fight against him we will be traitors</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>12226</quoteindex>
		<quote>My lord father would urge caution</quote>
	</quote>

		<quote>Wait let these two kings play their game of thrones</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quote>When they are done fighting we can bend our knees to the victor or oppose him as we choose</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quote>With Renly arming likely Lord Tywin would welcome a truce… and the safe return of his son</quote>
	</quote>
