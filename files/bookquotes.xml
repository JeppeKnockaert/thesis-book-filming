		<quote>They were cold things dead things that hated iron and fire and the touch of the sun and every creature with hot blood in its veins They swept over holdfasts and cities and kingdoms felled heroes and armies by the score riding their pale dead horses and leading hosts of the slain All the swords of men could not stay their advance and even maidens and suckling babes found no pity in them They hunted the maids through frozen forests and fed their dead servants on the flesh of human children</quote>

		<quote>Now these were the days before the Andals came and long before the women fled across the narrow sea from the cities of the Rhoyne and the hundred kingdoms of those times were the kingdoms of the First Men who had taken these lands from the children of the forest Yet here and there in the fastness of the woods the children still lived in their wooden cities and hollow hills and the faces in the trees kept watch So as cold and death filled the earth the last hero determined to seek out the children in the hopes that their ancient magics could win back what the armies of men had lost He set out into the dead lands with a sword a horse a dog and a dozen companions For years he searched until he despaired of ever finding the children of the forest in their secret cities One by one his friends died and his horse and finally even his dog and his sword froze so hard the blade snapped when he tried to use it And the Others smelled the hot blood in him and came silent on his trail stalking him with packs of pale white spiders big as hounds</quote>

		<quote>To be sure King Maekars summer was hotter than this one and near as long There were fools even in the Citadel who took that to mean that the Great Summer had come at last the summer that never ends but in the seventh year it broke suddenly and we had a short autumn and a terrible long winter Still the heat was fierce while it lasted Oldtown steamed and sweltered by day and came alive only by night We would walk in the gardens by the river and argue about the gods I remember the smells of those nights my lordperfume and sweat melons ripe to bursting peaches and pomegranates nightshade and moonbloom I was a young man then still forging my chain The heat did not exhaust me as it does now</quote>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2543</quoteindex>
		<quote>I did</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2544</quoteindex>
		<quote>If truth be told the Hand had not seemed quite himself for some time</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2545</quoteindex>
		<quote>We had sat together on council many a year he and I and the signs were there to read but I put them down to the great burdens he had borne so faithfully for so long Those broad shoulders were weighed down by all the cares of the realm and more besides His son was ever sickly and his lady wife so anxious that she would scarcely let the boy out of her sight It was enough to weary even a strong man and the Lord Jon was not young Small wonder if he seemed melancholy and tired Or so I thought at the time Yet now I am less certain</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2546</quoteindex>
		<quote>What can you tell me of his final illness</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2547</quoteindex>
		<quote>He came to me one day asking after a certain book as hale and healthy as ever though it did seem to me that something was troubling him deeply The next morning he was twisted over in pain too sick to rise from bed Maester Colemon thought it was a chill on the stomach The weather had been hot and the Hand often iced his wine which can upset the digestion When Lord Jon continued to weaken I went to him myself but the gods did not grant me the power to save him</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2548</quoteindex>
		<quote>I have heard that you sent Maester Colemon away</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2549</quoteindex>
		<quote>I did and I fear the Lady Lysa will never forgive me that Maybe I was wrong but at the time I thought it best Maester Colemon is like a son to me and I yield to none in my esteem for his abilities but he is young and the young ofttimes do not comprehend the frailty of an older body He was purging Lord Arryn with wasting potions and pepper juice and I feared he might kill him</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2550</quoteindex>
		<quote>Did Lord Arryn say anything to you during his final hours</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2551</quoteindex>
		<quote>In the last stage of his fever the Hand called out the name Robert several times but whether he was asking for his son or for the king I could not say Lady Lysa would not permit the boy to enter the sickroom for fear that he too might be taken ill The king did come and he sat beside the bed for hours talking and joking of times long past in hopes of raising Lord Jons spirits His love was fierce to see</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2552</quoteindex>
		<quote>Was there nothing else No final words</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2553</quoteindex>
		<quote>When I saw that all hope had fled I gave the Hand the milk of the poppy so he should not suffer Just before he closed his eyes for the last time he whispered something to the king and his lady wife a blessing for his son The seed is strong he said At the end his speech was too slurred to comprehend Death did not come until the next morning but Lord Jon was at peace after that He never spoke again</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2554</quoteindex>
		<quote>Did it seem to you that there was anything unnatural about Lord Arryns death</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2555</quoteindex>
		<quote>Unnatural</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2556</quoteindex>
		<quote>No I could not say so Sad for a certainty Yet in its own way death is the most natural thing of all Lord Eddard Jon Arryn rests easy now his burdens lifted at last</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2557</quoteindex>
		<quote>This illness that took him</quote>

		<quote>Under our good King Robert and Aerys Targaryen before him and his father Jaehaerys the Second before him and even for a few short months under Jaehaeryss father Aegon the Fortunate the Fifth of His Name I have seen more of illness than I care to remember my lord I will tell you this Every case is different and every case is alike Lord Jons death was no stranger than any other</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2561</quoteindex>
		<quote>His wife thought otherwise</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2562</quoteindex>
		<quote>I recall now the widow is sister to your own noble wife If an old man may be forgiven his blunt speech let me say that grief can derange even the strongest and most disciplined of minds and the Lady Lysa was never that Since her last stillbirth she has seen enemies in every shadow and the death of her lord husband left her shattered and lost</quote>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2567</quoteindex>
		<quote>A disturbing thought We are not the Free Cities where such things are common Grand Maester Aethelmure wrote that all men carry murder in their hearts yet even so the poisoner is beneath contempt</quote>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2568</quoteindex>
		<quote>What you suggest is possible my lord yet I do not think it likely Every hedge maester knows the common poisons and Lord Arryn displayed none of the signs And the Hand was loved by all What sort of monster in mans flesh would dare to murder such a noble lord</quote>

		<quote>Yes Khaleesi but the Dothraki look on these things differently than we do in the west I have told him as much as Illyrio told him but your brother does not listen The horselords are no traders Viserys thinks he sold you and now he wants his price Yet Khal Drogo would say he had you as a gift He will give Viserys a gift in return yes in his own time You do not demand a gift not of a khal You do not demand anything of a khal</quote>

		<quote>I am less certain They are better riders than any knight utterly fearless and their bows outrange ours In the Seven Kingdoms most archers fight on foot from behind a shieldwall or a barricade of sharpened stakes The Dothraki fire from horseback charging or retreating it makes no matter they are full as deadly and there are so many of them my lady Your lord husband alone counts forty thousand mounted warriors in his khalasar</quote>

		<quoteindex>4522</quoteindex>
		<quote>I asked why each link was a different metal A silver chain would look much finer with his grey robes I said Maester Luwin laughed A maester forges his chain with study he told me The different metals are each a different kind of learning gold for the study of money and accounts silver for healing iron for warcraft And he said there were other meanings as well The collar is supposed to remind a maester of the realm he serves isnt that so Lords are gold and knights steel but two links cant make a chain You also need silver and iron and lead tin and copper and bronze and all the rest and those are farmers and smiths and merchants and the like A chain needs all sorts of metals and a land needs all sorts of people</quote>

		<quote>I do not know Robb What I do know is that you have no choice If you go to Kings Landing and swear fealty you will never be allowed to leave If you turn your tail and retreat to Winterfell your lords will lose all respect for you Some may even go over to the Lannisters Then the queen with that much less to fear can do as she likes with her prisoners Our best hope our only true hope is that you can defeat the foe in the field If you should chance to take Lord Tywin or the Kingslayer captive why then a trade might very well be possible but that is not the heart of it So long as you have power enough that they must fear you Ned and your sister should be safe Cersei is wise enough to know that she may need them to make her peace should the fighting go against her</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6018</quoteindex>

		<quote>Less than a fortnight past they fought a battle in the hills below the Golden Tooth</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6024</quoteindex>
		<quote>Father must have known that because he sent out some men to oppose them under the kings own banner He gave the command to some southron lordling Lord Erik or Derik or something like that but Ser Raymun Darry rode with him and the letter said there were other knights as well and a force of Fathers own guardsmen Only it was a trap Lord Derik had no sooner crossed the Red Fork than the Lannisters fell upon him the kings banner be damned and Gregor Clegane took them in the rear as they tried to pull back across the Mummers Ford This Lord Derik and a few others may have escaped no one is certain but Ser Raymun was killed and most of our men from Winterfell Lord Tywin has closed off the kingsroad its said and now hes marching north toward Harrenhal burning as he goes</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6025</quoteindex>
		<quote>You mean to meet him here</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6026</quoteindex>
		<quote>If he comes so far but no one thinks he will</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6027</quoteindex>
		<quote>Ive sent word to Howland Reed Fathers old friend at Greywater Watch If the Lannisters come up the Neck the crannogmen will bleed them every step of the way but Galbart Glover says Lord Tywin is too smart for that and Roose Bolton agrees Hell stay close to the Trident they believe taking the castles of the river lords one by one until Riverrun stands alone We need to march south to meet him</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6028</quoteindex>
		<quote>Is that wise You are strongly placed here Its said that the old Kings in the North could stand at Moat Cailin and throw back hosts ten times the size of their own</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6029</quoteindex>
		<quote>Yes but our food and supplies are running low and this is not land we can live off easily Weve been waiting for Lord Manderly but now that his sons have joined us we need to march</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6030</quoteindex>
		<quote>Marching is all very well</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6031</quoteindex>
		<quote>but where and to what purpose What do you mean to do</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6032</quoteindex>
		<quote>The Greatjon thinks we should take the battle to Lord Tywin and surprise him</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6033</quoteindex>
		<quote>but the Glovers and the Karstarks feel wed be wiser to go around his army and join up with Uncle Ser Edmure against the Kingslayer</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6034</quoteindex>
		<quote>Though by the time we reach Riverrun Im not certain</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6035</quoteindex>
		<quote>Be certain</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6036</quoteindex>
		<quote>or go home and take up that wooden sword again You cannot afford to seem indecisive in front of men like Roose Bolton and Rickard Karstark Make no mistake Robbthese are your bannermen not your friends You named yourself battle commander Command</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6037</quoteindex>
		<quote>As you say Mother</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6038</quoteindex>
		<quote>Ill ask you again What do you mean to do</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6039</quoteindex>
		<quote>Both plans have virtues but look if we try to swing around Lord Tywins host we take the risk of being caught between him and the Kingslayer and if we attack him by all reports he has more men than I do and a lot more armored horse The Greatjon says that wont matter if we catch him with his breeches down but it seems to me that a man who has fought as many battles as Tywin Lannister wont be so easily surprised</quote>

	<quote>

	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>6044</quoteindex>
		<quote>When Lord Tywin gets word that weve come south hell march north to engage our main host leaving our riders free to hurry down the west bank to Riverrun</quote>

	<quote>
