		<quote>Its beautiful</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quote>Classic really</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>273</quoteindex>
		<quote>And in almost perfect balance with your profile</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>274</quoteindex>
		<quote>She has very clever fingers</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>275</quoteindex>
		<quote>Youre new arent you</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>276</quoteindex>
		<quote>I dont think Ive seen you before</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>277</quoteindex>
		<quote>Yes this is my first year in the Games</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>278</quoteindex>
		<quote>So they gave you District Twelve</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>279</quoteindex>
		<quote>I asked for District Twelve</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>280</quoteindex>
		<quote>Why dont you put on your robe and well have a chat</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>281</quoteindex>
		<quote>How despicable we must seem to you</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>282</quoteindex>
		<quote>No matter</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>283</quoteindex>
		<quote>So Katniss about your costume for the opening ceremonies</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>284</quoteindex>
		<quote>My partner Portia is the stylist for your fellow tribute Peeta</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>285</quoteindex>
		<quote>And our current thought is to dress you in complementary costumes</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>286</quoteindex>
		<quote>As you know its customary to reflect the flavor of the district</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>287</quoteindex>
		<quote>So Ill be in a coal miner outfit</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>288</quoteindex>
		<quote>Not exactly</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>289</quoteindex>
		<quote>You see Portia and I think that coal miner things very overdone</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>290</quoteindex>
		<quote>No one will remember you in that</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>291</quoteindex>
		<quote>And we both see it as our job to make the District Twelve tributes unforgettable</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>292</quoteindex>
		<quote>So rather than focus on the coal mining itself were going to focus on the coal</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>293</quoteindex>
		<quote>And what do we do with coal</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>294</quoteindex>
		<quote>We burn it</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>295</quoteindex>
		<quote>Youre not afraid of fire are you Katniss</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>296</quoteindex>
		<quote>Its not real flame of course just a little synthetic fire Portia and I came up with</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>297</quoteindex>
		<quote>Youll be perfectly safe</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>298</quoteindex>
		<quote>I want the audience to recognize you when youre in the arena</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>299</quoteindex>
		<quote>Katniss the girl who was on fire</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>300</quoteindex>
		<quote>What do you think</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>301</quoteindex>
		<quote>About the fire</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>302</quoteindex>
		<quote>Ill rip off your cape if youll rip off mine</quote>

		<quote>Deal</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>304</quoteindex>
		<quote>I know we promised Haymitch wed do exactly what they said but I dont think he considered this angle</quote>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>305</quoteindex>
		<quote>Where is Haymitch anyway</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>306</quoteindex>
		<quote>Isnt he supposed to protect us from this sort of thing</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>307</quoteindex>
		<quote>With all that alcohol in him its probably not advisable to have him around an open flame</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>308</quoteindex>
		<quote>Here we go then</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quoteindex>329</quoteindex>
		<quote>Ive been very mysterious though</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>330</quoteindex>
		<quote>Because of course Haymitch hasnt bothered to tell me your strategies</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>331</quoteindex>
		<quote>But Ive done my best with what I had to work with</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>332</quoteindex>
		<quote>How Katniss sacrificed herself for her sister</quote>

		<quoteindex>333</quoteindex>
		<quote>How youve both successfully struggled to overcome the barbarism of your district</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>334</quoteindex>
		<quote>Unfortunately I cant seal the sponsor deals for you</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>335</quoteindex>
		<quote>Only Haymitch can do that</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>336</quoteindex>
		<quote>But dont worry Ill get him to the table at gunpoint if necessary</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>337</quoteindex>
		<quote>What makes it burn</quote>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1764</quoteindex>
		<quote>I mean whats on the far side of the circle</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1765</quoteindex>
		<quote>A field</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1766</quoteindex>
		<quote>As far as you can see its full of grasses as high as my shoulders</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1767</quoteindex>
		<quote>I dont know maybe some of them are grain</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1768</quoteindex>
		<quote>There are patches of different colors</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1769</quoteindex>
		<quote>But there are no paths</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1770</quoteindex>
		<quote>I bet some of them are grain</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1771</quoteindex>
		<quote>I bet Thresh knows which ones too</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1772</quoteindex>
		<quote>Did you go in there</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1773</quoteindex>
		<quote>No</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1774</quoteindex>
		<quote>Nobody really wanted to track Thresh down in that grass</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1775</quoteindex>
		<quote>It has a sinister feeling to it</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1776</quoteindex>
		<quote>Every time I look at that field all I can think of are hidden things</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1777</quoteindex>
		<quote>Snakes and rabid animals and quicksand</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1778</quoteindex>
		<quote>There could be anything in there</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1779</quoteindex>
		<quote>Maybe there is a bread bush in that field</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1780</quoteindex>
		<quote>Maybe thats why Thresh looks better fed now than when we started the Games</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1781</quoteindex>
		<quote>Either that or hes got very generous sponsors</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1782</quoteindex>
		<quote>I wonder what wed have to do to get Haymitch to send us some bread</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1783</quoteindex>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1833</quoteindex>
		<quote>Your hand shot right up in the air</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1834</quoteindex>
		<quote>She stood you up on a stool and had you sing it for us</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1835</quoteindex>
		<quote>And I swear every bird outside the windows fell silent</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1836</quoteindex>

		<quoteindex>1837</quoteindex>
		<quote>No it happened</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1838</quoteindex>
		<quote>And right when your song ended I knew just like your motherI was a goner</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1839</quoteindex>
		<quote>Then for the next eleven years I tried to work up the nerve to talk to you</quote>

	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2096</quoteindex>
		<quote>I guess it could happen at any moment</quote>

		<quote>Well until they do no sense in wasting a hunting day</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2100</quoteindex>
		<quote>But we should probably eat as much as we can hold just in case we run into trouble</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2101</quoteindex>
		<quote>Not even a little damp</quote>
	</quote>

		<quote>Yes I guess that was it</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2299</quoteindex>
		<quote>I mean until that point I just tried not to think about what my feelings might be honestly because it was so confusing and it only made things worse if I actually cared about him</quote>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2300</quoteindex>
		<quote>But then in the tree everything changed</quote>
