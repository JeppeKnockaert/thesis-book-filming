		<quotetext>I couldn&apos;t help what—</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>107</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well, you have to help it this time.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>108</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You can&apos;t clock out and leave Prim on her own.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>109</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There&apos;s no me now to keep you both alive.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>110</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It doesn&apos;t matter what happens.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>Whatever you see on the screen.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>112</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You have to promise me you&apos;ll fight through it!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>113</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I was ill.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>114</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I could have treated myself if I&apos;d had the medicine I have now.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>115</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Then take it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>116</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And take care of her!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>I&apos;ll be all right, Katniss,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>118</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But you have to take care, too.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>119</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;re so fast and brave.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>120</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Maybe you can win.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>121</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Maybe,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>122</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Then we&apos;d be rich as Haymitch.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>123</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I don&apos;t care if we&apos;re rich.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>124</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I just want you to come home.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>You will try, won&apos;t you?</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Thank you,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>132</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I had some of your bread this morning.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>133</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My friend Gale gave you a squirrel for it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>134</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Not your best trade,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>135</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ll keep an eye on the little girl.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>136</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Make sure she&apos;s eating.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>137</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They let you wear one thing from your district in the arena.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>138</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>One thing to remind you of home.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>139</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Will you wear this?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>140</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your pin?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>141</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Here, I&apos;ll put it on your dress, all right?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>142</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Promise you&apos;ll wear it into the arena, Katniss?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>143</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Promise?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>144</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>145</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Listen,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>146</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Getting a knife should be pretty easy, but you&apos;ve got to get your hands on a bow.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>147</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That&apos;s your best chance.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>148</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They don&apos;t always have bows,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>149</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Then make one,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>150</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Even a weak bow is better than no bow at all.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>151</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I don&apos;t even know if there&apos;ll be wood,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>152</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There&apos;s almost always some wood,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>153</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Since that year half of them died of cold.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>154</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Not much entertainment in that.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>155</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes, there&apos;s usually some,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>156</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Katniss, it&apos;s just hunting.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>157</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;re the best hunter I know,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>158</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s not just hunting.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>159</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They&apos;re armed.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>160</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They think,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>161</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So do you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>162</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And you&apos;ve had more practice.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>163</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Real practice,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>164</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You know how to kill.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>165</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Not people,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>166</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How different can it be, really?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>167</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Don&apos;t let them starve!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>168</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I won&apos;t!</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>Katniss, remember I—</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>171</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Where&apos;s Haymitch?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>172</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Last time I saw him, he said he was going to take a nap,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>173</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well, it&apos;s been an exhausting day,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>174</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>At least, you two have decent manners,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>175</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The pair last year ate everything with their hands like a couple of savages.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>176</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It completely upset my digestion.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>177</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your mentor has a lot to learn about presentation.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>178</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A lot about televised behavior.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>179</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He was drunk,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>They call it hot chocolate,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>It&apos;s good.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>I won&apos;t unless I bring it home.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>So, you&apos;re supposed to give us advice,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>213</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Here&apos;s some advice.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>214</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Stay alive,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>215</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That&apos;s very funny,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>216</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Only not to us.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>217</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well, what&apos;s this?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>218</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Did I actually get a pair of fighters this year?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>219</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>220</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Let the bruise show.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>221</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The audience will think you&apos;ve mixed it up with another tribute before you&apos;ve even made it to the arena.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>222</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That&apos;s against the rules,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>223</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Only if they catch you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>224</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That bruise will say you fought, you weren&apos;t caught, even better,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>225</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Can you hit anything with that knife besides a table?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>226</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Stand over here.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>227</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Both of you,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>228</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well, you&apos;re not entirely hopeless.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>229</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Seem fit.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>230</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And once the stylists get hold of you, you&apos;ll be attractive enough.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>231</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>All right, I&apos;ll make a deal with you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>232</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You don&apos;t interfere with my drinking, and I&apos;ll stay sober enough to help you,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>233</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But you have to do exactly what I say.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>234</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Fine,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>235</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So help us,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>236</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>When we get to the arena, what&apos;s the best strategy at the Cornucopia for someone—</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>237</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>One thing at a time.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>238</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>In a few minutes, we&apos;ll be pulling into the station.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>239</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;ll be put in the hands of your stylists.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>240</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;re not going to like what they do to you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>241</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But no matter what it is, don&apos;t resist,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>242</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But—</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>243</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No buts.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>244</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Don&apos;t resist,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>245</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Who knows?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>246</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>One of them may be rich.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>247</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Sorry!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>248</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;re just so hairy!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>249</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Good news, though.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>250</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This is the last one.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>251</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ready?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>252</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;re doing very well,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>253</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If there&apos;s one thing we can&apos;t stand, it&apos;s a whiner.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>254</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Grease her down!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>255</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Excellent!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>256</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You almost look like a human being now!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>257</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Thank you,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>258</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We don&apos;t have much cause to look nice in District Twelve.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>259</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Of course, you don&apos;t, you poor darling!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>260</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But don&apos;t worry,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>261</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>By the time Cinna is through with you, you&apos;re going to be absolutely gorgeous!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>262</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We promise!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>263</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You know, now that we&apos;ve gotten rid of all the hair and filth, you&apos;re not horrible at all!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>264</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Let&apos;s call Cinna!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>265</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Hello, Katniss.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>266</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m Cinna, your stylist,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>267</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Hello,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>268</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Just give me a moment, all right?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>269</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Who did your hair?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>270</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My mother,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>271</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s beautiful.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>272</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Classic really.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>273</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And in almost perfect balance with your profile.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>274</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She has very clever fingers,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>275</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;re new, aren&apos;t you?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>276</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve seen you before,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>277</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes, this is my first year in the Games,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>278</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So they gave you District Twelve,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>279</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I asked for District Twelve,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>280</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why don&apos;t you put on your robe and we&apos;ll have a chat.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>281</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How despicable we must seem to you,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>282</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No matter,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>283</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So, Katniss, about your costume for the opening ceremonies.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>284</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My partner, Portia, is the stylist for your fellow tribute, Peeta.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>285</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And our current thought is to dress you in complementary costumes,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>286</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>As you know, it&apos;s customary to reflect the flavor of the district.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>287</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So, I&apos;ll be in a coal miner outfit?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>288</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Not exactly.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>289</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You see, Portia and I think that coal miner thing&apos;s very overdone.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>290</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No one will remember you in that.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>291</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And we both see it as our job to make the District Twelve tributes unforgettable,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>292</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So rather than focus on the coal mining itself, we&apos;re going to focus on the coal,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>293</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And what do we do with coal?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>294</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We burn it,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>295</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;re not afraid of fire, are you, Katniss?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>296</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s not real flame, of course, just a little synthetic fire Portia and I came up with.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>297</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;ll be perfectly safe,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>298</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I want the audience to recognize you when you&apos;re in the arena,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>299</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Katniss, the girl who was on fire.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>300</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What do you think?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>301</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>About the fire?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>302</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ll rip off your cape if you&apos;ll rip off mine,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>303</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Deal,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>304</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I know we promised Haymitch we&apos;d do exactly what they said, but I don&apos;t think he considered this angle.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>305</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Where is Haymitch, anyway?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>306</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Isn&apos;t he supposed to protect us from this sort of thing?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>307</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>With all that alcohol in him, it&apos;s probably not advisable to have him around an open flame,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>308</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Here we go then,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>309</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It works.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>310</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Remember, heads high.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>311</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Smiles.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>312</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They&apos;re going to love you!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>313</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What&apos;s he saying?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>314</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I think he said for us to hold hands,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>315</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>District Twelve!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>316</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Katniss!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>317</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Katniss!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>318</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No, don&apos;t let go of me,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>319</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Please.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>320</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I might fall out of this thing.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>321</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Okay,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>322</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Thanks for keeping hold of me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>323</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I was getting a little shaky there,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>324</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It didn&apos;t show,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>325</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m sure no one noticed.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>326</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m sure they didn&apos;t notice anything but you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>327</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You should wear flames more often,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>328</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They suit you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>329</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ve been very mysterious, though,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>330</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Because, of course, Haymitch hasn&apos;t bothered to tell me your strategies.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>331</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But I&apos;ve done my best with what I had to work with.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>332</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How Katniss sacrificed herself for her sister.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>333</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How you&apos;ve both successfully struggled to overcome the barbarism of your district.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>334</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Unfortunately, I can&apos;t seal the sponsor deals for you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>335</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Only Haymitch can do that,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>336</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But don&apos;t worry, I&apos;ll get him to the table at gunpoint if necessary.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>337</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What makes it burn?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>338</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Is it alcohol?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>339</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That&apos;s the last thing I wa—oh!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>340</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I know you!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>341</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Don&apos;t be ridiculous, Katniss.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>342</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How could you possibly know an Avox?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>343</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The very thought.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>344</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What&apos;s an Avox?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>345</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Someone who committed a crime.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>346</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They cut her tongue so she can&apos;t speak,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>347</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She&apos;s probably a traitor of some sort.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>348</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Not likely you&apos;d know her.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>349</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And even if you did, you&apos;re not to speak to one of them unless it&apos;s to give an order,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>350</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Of course, you don&apos;t really know her.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>351</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No, I guess not, I just—</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>352</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Delly Cartwright.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>353</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That&apos;s who it is.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>354</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I kept thinking she looked familiar as well.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>355</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Then I realized she&apos;s a dead ringer for Delly.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>356</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Of course, that&apos;s who I was thinking of.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>357</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It must be the hair,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>358</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Something about the eyes, too,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>359</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, well.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>360</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If that&apos;s all it is,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>361</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And yes, the cake has spirits, but all the alcohol has burned off.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>362</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I ordered it specially in honor of your fiery debut.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>363</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ahh!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>364</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Whose idea was the hand holding?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>365</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Cinna&apos;s,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>366</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Just the perfect touch of rebellion,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>367</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Very nice.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>368</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Tomorrow morning is the first training session.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>369</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Meet me for breakfast and I&apos;ll tell you exactly how I want you to play it,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>370</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Now go get some sleep while the grown-ups talk.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>371</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So, Delly Cartwright.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>372</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Imagine finding her lookalike here.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>373</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Have you been on the roof yet?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>374</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Cinna showed me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>375</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You can practically see the whole city.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>376</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The wind&apos;s a bit loud, though.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>377</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No one will overhear us talking</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>378</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Can we just go up?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>379</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Sure, come on,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>380</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I asked Cinna why they let us up here.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>381</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Weren&apos;t they worried that some of the tributes might decide to jump right over the side?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>382</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What&apos;d he say?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>383</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You can&apos;t,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>384</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Some kind of electric field throws you back on the roof.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>385</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Always worried about our safety,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>386</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do you think they&apos;re watching us now?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>387</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Maybe,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>388</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Come see the garden.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>389</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We were hunting in the woods one day.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>390</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Hidden, waiting for game,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>391</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You and your father?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>392</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No, my friend Gale.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>393</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Suddenly all the birds stopped singing at once.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>394</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Except one.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>395</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>As if it were giving a warning call.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>396</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And then we saw her.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>397</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m sure it was the same girl.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>398</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A boy was with her.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>399</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Their clothes were tattered.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>400</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They had dark circles under their eyes from no sleep.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>401</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They were running as if their lives depended on it,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>402</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The hovercraft appeared out of nowhere,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>403</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I mean, one moment the sky was empty and the next it was there.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>404</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It didn&apos;t make a sound, but they saw it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>405</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A net dropped down on the girl and carried her up, fast, so fast like the elevator.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>406</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They shot some sort of spear through the boy.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>407</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It was attached to a cable and they hauled him up as well.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>408</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But I&apos;m certain he was dead.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>409</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We heard the girl scream once.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>410</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The boy&apos;s name, I think.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>411</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Then it was gone, the hovercraft.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>412</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Vanished into thin air.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>413</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And the birds began to sing again, as if nothing had happened.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>414</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Did they see you?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>415</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I don&apos;t know.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>416</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We were under a shelf of rock,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>417</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;re shivering,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>418</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They were from here?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>419</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Where do you suppose they were going?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>420</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I don&apos;t know that,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>421</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Or why they would leave here.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>422</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;d leave here,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>423</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;d go home now if they let me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>424</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But you have to admit, the food&apos;s prime.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>425</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s getting chilly.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>426</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We better go in,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>427</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your friend Gale.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>428</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He&apos;s the one who took your sister away at the reaping?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>429</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>430</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do you know him?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>431</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Not really.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>432</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I hear the girls talk about him a lot.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>433</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I thought he was your cousin or something.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>434</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You favor each other,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>435</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No, we&apos;re not related,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>436</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Did he come to say good-bye to you?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>437</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>438</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So did your father.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>439</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He brought me cookies.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>440</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Really?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>441</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well, he likes you and your sister.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>442</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I think he wishes he had a daughter instead of a houseful of boys.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>443</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He knew your mother when they were kids,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>444</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, yes.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>445</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She grew up in town,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>446</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>See you in the morning then.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>447</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>See you,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>448</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, sorry,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>449</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I was supposed to get those back to Cinna.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>450</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m sorry.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>451</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Can you take them to him?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>452</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So, let&apos;s get down to business.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>453</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Training.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>454</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>First off, if you like, I&apos;ll coach you separately.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>455</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Decide now.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>456</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why would you coach us separately?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>457</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Say if you had a secret skill you might not want the other to know about,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>458</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I don&apos;t have any secret skills,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>459</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And I already know what yours is, right?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>460</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I mean, I&apos;ve eaten enough of your squirrels.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>461</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You can coach us together,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>462</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>All right, so give me some idea of what you can do,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>463</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I can&apos;t do anything,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>464</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Unless you count baking bread.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>465</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Sorry, I don&apos;t.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>466</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Katniss.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>467</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I already know you&apos;re handy with a knife,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>468</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Not really.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>469</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But I can hunt,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>470</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>With a bow and arrow.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>471</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And you&apos;re good?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>472</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m all right,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>473</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She&apos;s excellent,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>474</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My father buys her squirrels.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>475</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He always comments on how the arrows never pierce the body.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>476</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She hits every one in the eye.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>477</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s the same with the rabbits she sells the butcher.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>478</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She can even bring down deer.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>479</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What are you doing?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>480</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What are you doing?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>481</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If he&apos;s going to help you, he has to know what you&apos;re capable of.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>482</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Don&apos;t underrate yourself,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>483</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What about you?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>484</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ve seen you in the market.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>485</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You can lift hundredpound bags of flour,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>486</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Tell him that.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>487</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That&apos;s not nothing.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>488</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes, and I&apos;m sure the arena will be full of bags of flour for me to chuck at people.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>489</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s not like being able to use a weapon.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>490</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You know it isn&apos;t,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>491</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He can wrestle,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>492</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He came in second in our school competition last year, only after his brother.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>493</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What use is that?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>494</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How many times have you seen someone wrestle someone to death?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>495</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There&apos;s always hand-to-hand combat.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>496</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>All you need is to come up with a knife, and you&apos;ll at least stand a chance.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>497</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If I get jumped, I&apos;m dead!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>498</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But you won&apos;t!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>499</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;ll be living up in some tree eating raw squirrels and picking off people with arrows.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>500</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You know what my mother said to me when she came to say good-bye, as if to cheer me up, she says maybe District Twelve will finally have a winner.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>501</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Then I realized, she didn&apos;t mean me, she meant you!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>502</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, she meant you,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>503</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She said, ‘She&apos;s a survivor, that one.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>504</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>’ She is,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>505</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But only because someone helped me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>506</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>People will help you in the arena.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>507</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They&apos;ll be tripping over each other to sponsor you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>508</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No more than you,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>509</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She has no idea.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>510</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The effect she can have.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>511</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well, then.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>512</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well, well, well.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>513</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Katniss, there&apos;s no guarantee they&apos;ll be bows and arrows in the arena, but during your private session with the Gamemakers, show them what you can do.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>514</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Until then, stay clear of archery.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>515</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Are you any good at trapping?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>516</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I know a few basic snares,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>517</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That may be significant in terms of food,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>518</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And Peeta, she&apos;s right, never underestimate strength in the arena.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>519</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Very often, physical power tilts the advantage to a player.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>520</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>In the Training Center, they will have weights, but don&apos;t reveal how much you can lift in front of the other tributes.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>521</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The plan&apos;s the same for both of you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>522</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You go to group training.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>543</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>At home.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>544</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The iced ones, for the bakery,</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>545</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s lovely.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>546</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If only you could frost someone to death,</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>547</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Don&apos;t be so superior.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>548</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You can never tell what you&apos;ll find in the arena.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>549</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Say it&apos;s actually a gigantic cake—</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>550</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Say we move on,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>551</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And there you have it,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>552</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You certainly know a lot,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>553</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Only about bread,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>554</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Okay, now laugh as if I&apos;ve said something funny.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>All right, I&apos;ll keep smiling pleasantly and you talk,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Did I ever tell you about the time I was chased by a bear?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>557</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No, but it sounds fascinating,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>558</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I think we have a shadow.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>559</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I think her name&apos;s Rue,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>560</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What can we do about it?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>561</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Nothing to do,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>562</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Just making conversation.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>563</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Someone ought to get Haymitch a drink.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>564</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Don&apos;t.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>565</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Don&apos;t let&apos;s pretend when there&apos;s no one around.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>566</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>All right, Katniss,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>567</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Remember what Haymitch said about being sure to throw the weights.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>568</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Thanks.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>569</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I will,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>570</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You... shoot straight.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>571</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Thank you for your consideration,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>572</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Okay, enough small talk, just how bad were you today?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>573</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I don&apos;t know that it mattered.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>574</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>By the time I showed up, no one even bothered to look at me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>575</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They were singing some kind of drinking song, I think.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>576</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So, I threw around some heavy objects until they told me I could go.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>577</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And you, sweetheart?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>578</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I shot an arrow at the Gamemakers.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>579</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You what?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>580</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I shot an arrow at them.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>581</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Not exactly at them.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>582</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>In their direction.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>583</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s like Peeta said, I was shooting and they were ignoring me and I just... I just lost my head, so I shot an apple out of their stupid roast pig&apos;s mouth!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>584</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And what did they say?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>585</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Nothing.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>586</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Or I don&apos;t know.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>587</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I walked out after that,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>588</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Without being dismissed?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>589</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I dismissed myself,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>590</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well, that&apos;s that,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>591</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do you think they&apos;ll arrest me?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>592</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Doubt it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>593</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Be a pain to replace you at this stage,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>594</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What about my family?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>595</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Will they punish them?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>596</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Don&apos;t think so.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>597</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Wouldn&apos;t make much sense.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>598</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>See they&apos;d have to reveal what happened in the Training Center for it to have any worthwhile effect on the population.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>599</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>People would need to know what you did.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>600</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But they can&apos;t since it&apos;s secret, so it&apos;d be a waste of effort,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>601</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>More likely they&apos;ll make your life hell in the arena.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>602</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well, they&apos;ve already promised to do that to us any way,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>603</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Very true,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>604</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What were their faces like?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>605</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Shocked.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>606</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Terrified.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>607</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Uh, ridiculous, some of them.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>608</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>One man tripped backward into a bowl of punch.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>609</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well, it serves them right.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>610</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s their job to pay attention to you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>611</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And just because you come from District Twelve is no excuse to ignore you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>612</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m sorry, but that&apos;s what I think,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>613</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ll get a very bad score,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>614</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Scores only matter if they&apos;re very good, no one pays much attention to the bad or mediocre ones.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>615</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>For all they know, you could be hiding your talents to get a low score on purpose.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>616</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>People use that strategy,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>617</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I hope that&apos;s how people interpret the four I&apos;ll probably get,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>618</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If that.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>619</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Really, is anything less impressive than watching a person pick up a heavy ball and throw it a couple of yards.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>620</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>One almost landed on my foot.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>621</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There must be a mistake.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>622</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How... how could that happen?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>623</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Guess they liked your temper,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>624</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They&apos;ve got a show to put on.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>625</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They need some players with some heat.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>626</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Katniss, the girl who was on fire,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>627</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, wait until you see your interview dress.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>628</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>More flames?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>629</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Of a sort,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>630</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That&apos;s dangerous.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>631</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What&apos;s your name?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>632</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Katniss,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>633</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well, Catnip, stealing&apos;s punishable by death, or hadn&apos;t you heard?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>634</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Katniss,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>635</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And I wasn&apos;t stealing it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>636</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I just wanted to look at your snare.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>637</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Mine never catch anything.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>638</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So where&apos;d you get the squirrel?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>639</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I shot it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>640</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Can I see that?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>641</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Just remember, stealing&apos;s punishable by death.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>642</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well, there&apos;s some room for improvement there.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>643</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>big, big, big day!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>644</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So, what&apos;s going on?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>645</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;re coaching us on interviews today, right?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>646</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That&apos;s right,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>647</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You don&apos;t have to wait until I&apos;m done.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>648</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I can listen and cat at the same time,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>649</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well, there&apos;s been a change of plans.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>650</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>About our current approach,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>651</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What&apos;s that?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>652</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Peeta has asked to be coached separately.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>653</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Good,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>654</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So what&apos;s the schedule?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>655</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;ll each have four hours with Effie for presentation and four with me for content,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>656</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You start with Effie, Katniss.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>657</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Not above the ankle!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>658</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well, that&apos;s the best I can do,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>659</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Just remember, Katniss, you want the audience to like you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>660</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And you don&apos;t think they will?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>661</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Not if you glare at them the entire time.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>662</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why don&apos;t you save that for the arena?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>663</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Instead, think of yourself among friends,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>664</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They&apos;re betting on how long I&apos;ll live!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>665</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They&apos;re not my friends!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>666</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well, try and pretend!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>667</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>See, like this.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>668</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m smiling at you even though you&apos;re aggravating me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>669</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes, it feels very convincing,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>670</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m going to eat.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>671</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>672</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m trying to figure out what to do with you,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>673</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How we&apos;re going to present you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>674</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Are you going to be charming?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>675</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Aloof?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>676</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Fierce?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>677</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So far, you&apos;re shining like a star.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>678</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You volunteered to save your sister.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>679</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Cinna made you look unforgettable.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>680</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;ve got the top training score.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>681</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>People are intrigued, but no one knows who you are.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>682</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The impression you make tomorrow will decide exactly what I can get you in terms of sponsors,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>683</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What&apos;s Peeta&apos;s approach?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>684</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Or am I not allowed to ask?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>685</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Likable.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>686</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He has a sort of self-deprecating humor naturally,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>687</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Whereas when you open your mouth, you come across more as sullen and hostile.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>688</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I do not!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>689</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Please.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>690</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I don&apos;t know where you pulled that cheery, wavy girl on the chariot from, but I haven&apos;t seen her before or since,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>691</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And you&apos;ve given me so many reasons to be cheery,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>692</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But you don&apos;t have to please me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>693</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m not going to sponsor you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>694</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So pretend I&apos;m the audience,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>695</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Delight me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>696</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Fine!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>697</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>All right, enough,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>698</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We&apos;ve got to find another angle.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>699</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Not only are you hostile, I don&apos;t know anything about you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>700</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ve asked you fifty questions and still have no sense of your life, your family, what you care about.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>701</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They want to know about you, Katniss.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>702</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But I don&apos;t want them to!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>703</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They&apos;re already taking my future!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>704</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They can&apos;t have the things that mattered to me in the past!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>705</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Then lie!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>706</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Make something up!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>707</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m not good at lying,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>708</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well, you better learn fast.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>709</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;ve got about as much charm as a dead slug,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>710</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Here&apos;s an idea.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>711</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Try acting humble.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>712</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Humble,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>713</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That you can&apos;t believe a little girl from District Twelve has done this well.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>714</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The whole thing&apos;s been more than you ever could have dreamed of.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>715</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Talk about Cinna&apos;s clothes.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>716</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How nice the people are.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>717</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How the city amazes you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>718</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If you won&apos;t talk about yourself, at least compliment the audience.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>719</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Just keep turning it back around, all right.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>720</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Gush.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>721</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>vulnerable</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>722</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I give up, sweetheart.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>723</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Just answer the questions and try not to let the audience see how openly you despise them.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>724</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Just leave it!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>725</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Just leave it alone!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>726</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I should have tried to save you,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>727</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No, it was wrong,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>728</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Close your eyes,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>729</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Can I open my eyes?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>730</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>731</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Open them.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>732</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, Cinna,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>733</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Thank you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>734</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Twirl for me,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>735</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So, all ready for the interview then?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>736</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m awful.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>737</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Haymitch called me a dead slug.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>738</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No matter what we tried, I couldn&apos;t do it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>739</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I just can&apos;t be one of those people he wants me to be,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>740</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why don&apos;t you just be yourself?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>741</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Myself?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>742</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That&apos;s no good, either.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>743</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Haymitch says I&apos;m sullen and hostile,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>744</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well, you are... around Haymitch,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>745</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I don&apos;t find you so.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>746</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The prep team adores you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>747</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You even won over the Gamemakers.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>748</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And as for the citizens of the Capitol, well, they can&apos;t stop talking about you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>749</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No one can help but admire your spirit.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>750</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Suppose, when you answer the questions, you think you&apos;re addressing a friend back home.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>751</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Who would your best friend be?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>752</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Gale,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>753</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Only it doesn&apos;t make sense, Cinna.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>754</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I would never be telling Gale those things about me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>755</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He already knows them.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>756</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What about me?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>757</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Could you think of me as a friend?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>758</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I think so, but—</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>759</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ll be sitting on the main platform with the other stylists.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>760</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;ll be able to look right at me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>761</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>When you&apos;re asked a question, find me, and answer it as honestly as possible,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>762</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Even if what I think is horrible?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>763</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Especially if what you think is horrible,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>764</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;ll try it?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>765</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Cinna...</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>766</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Remember, they already love you,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>767</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Just be yourself.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>768</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Remember, you&apos;re still a happy pair.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>769</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So act like it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>770</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m very hard to catch,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>771</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And if they can&apos;t catch me, they can&apos;t kill me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>772</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So don&apos;t count me out.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>773</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I wouldn&apos;t in a million years,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>774</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So, Katniss, the Capitol must be quite a change from District Twelve.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>775</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What&apos;s impressed you most since you arrived here?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>776</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What&apos;s impressed you most since you arrived here?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>777</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The lamb stew,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>778</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The one with the dried plums?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>779</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, I eat it by the bucketful.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>780</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It doesn&apos;t show, does it?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>781</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Now, Katniss,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>782</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>When you came out in the opening ceremonies, my heart actually stopped.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>783</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What did you think of that costume?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>784</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You mean after I got over my fear of being burned alive?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>785</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>786</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Start then,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>787</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I thought Cinna was brilliant and it was the most gorgeous costume I&apos;d ever seen and I couldn&apos;t believe I was wearing it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>788</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I can&apos;t believe I&apos;m wearing this, either.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>789</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I mean, look at it!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>790</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, do that again!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>791</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Don&apos;t stop!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>792</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have to, I&apos;m dizzy!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>793</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Don&apos;t worry, I&apos;ve got you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>794</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Can&apos;t have you following in your mentor&apos;s footsteps.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>795</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s all right,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>796</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She&apos;s safe with me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>797</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So, how about that training score.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>798</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>E-le-ven.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>799</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Give us a hint what happened in there.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>800</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Um... all I can say, is I think it was a first.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>801</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;re killing us,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>802</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Details.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>803</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Details.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>804</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m not supposed to talk about it, right?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>805</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She&apos;s not!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>806</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Thank you,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>807</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Sorry.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>808</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My lips are sealed.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>809</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Let&apos;s go back then, to the moment they called your sister&apos;s name at the reaping,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>810</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And you volunteered.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>811</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Can you tell us about her?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>812</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Her name&apos;s Prim.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>813</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She&apos;s just twelve.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>814</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And I love her more than anything.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>815</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What did she say to you?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>816</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>After the reaping?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>817</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She asked me to try really hard to win.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>818</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And what did you say?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>819</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I swore I would.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>820</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I bet you did,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>821</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Sorry we&apos;re out of time.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>822</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Best of luck, Katniss Everdeen, tribute from District Twelve.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>823</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Tell me, do I still smell like roses?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>824</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Handsome lad like you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>825</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There must be some special girl.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>826</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Come on, what&apos;s her name?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>827</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well, there is this one girl.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>828</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ve had a crush on her ever since I can remember.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>829</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But I&apos;m pretty sure she didn&apos;t know I was alive until the reaping.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>830</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She have another fellow?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>831</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I don&apos;t know, but a lot of boys like her,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>832</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So, here&apos;s what you do.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>833</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You win, you go home.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>834</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She can&apos;t turn you down then, eh?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>835</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I don&apos;t think it&apos;s going to work out.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>836</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Winning... won&apos;t help in my case,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>837</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why ever not?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>838</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Because... because... she came here with me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>839</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, that is a piece of bad luck,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>840</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s not good,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>841</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well, I don&apos;t think any of us can blame you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>842</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;d be hard not to fall for that young lady,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>843</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She didn&apos;t know?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>844</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Not until now.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>845</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Wouldn&apos;t you love to pull her back out here and get a response?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>846</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Sadly, rules are rules, and Katniss Everdeen&apos;s time has been spent.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>847</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well, best of luck to you, Peeta Mellark, and I think I speak for all of Panem when I say our hearts go with yours.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>848</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Thank you</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>849</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What was that for?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>850</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You had no right!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>851</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No right to go saying those things about me!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>852</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What&apos;s going on?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>853</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Did you fall?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>854</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>After she shoved me,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>855</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Shoved him?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>856</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This was your idea, wasn&apos;t it?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>857</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Turning me into some kind of fool in front of the entire country?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>858</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It was my idea,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>859</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Haymitch just helped me with it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>860</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes, Haymitch is very helpful.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>861</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>To you!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>862</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You are a fool,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>863</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do you think he hurt you?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>864</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That boy just gave you something you could never achieve on your own.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>865</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He made me look weak!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>866</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He made you look desirable!</quotetext>
	</quote>

	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>868</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You were about as romantic as dirt until he said he wanted you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>869</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Now they all do.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>870</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;re all they&apos;re talking about.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>871</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The star-crossed lovers from District Twelve!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>872</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But we&apos;re not star-crossed lovers!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>873</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Who cares?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>874</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s all a big show.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>875</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s all how you&apos;re perceived.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>876</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The most I could say about you after your interview was that you were nice enough, although that in itself was a small miracle.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>877</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Now I can say you&apos;re a heartbreaker.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>878</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, oh, oh, how the boys back home fall longingly at your feet.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>879</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Which do you think will get you more sponsors?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>880</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He&apos;s right, Katniss.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>881</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I should have been told, so I didn&apos;t look so stupid.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>882</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No, your reaction was perfect.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>883</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If you&apos;d known, it wouldn&apos;t have read as real,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>884</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She&apos;s just worried about her boyfriend,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>885</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I don&apos;t have a boyfriend.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>886</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Whatever,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>887</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But I bet he&apos;s smart enough to know a bluff when he sees it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>888</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Besides you didn&apos;t say you loved me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>889</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So what does it matter?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>890</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>After he said he loved me, did you think I could be in love with him, too?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>891</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I did,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>892</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The way you avoided looking at the cameras, the blush.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>893</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;re golden, sweetheart.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>894</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;re going to have sponsors lined up around the block,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>895</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m sorry I shoved you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>896</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Doesn&apos;t matter,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>897</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Although it&apos;s technically illegal.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>898</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Are your hands okay?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>899</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They&apos;ll be all right,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>900</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Come on, let&apos;s eat,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>901</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I wouldn&apos;t be at all surprised if I finally get promoted to a decent district next year!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>902</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Any final words of advice?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>903</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>When the gong sounds, get the hell out of there.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>904</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;re neither of you up to the blood bath at the Cornucopia.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>905</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Just clear out, put as much distance as you can between yourselves and the others, and find a source of water,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>906</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Got it?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>907</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And after that?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>908</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Stay alive,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>909</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You should be getting some sleep.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>910</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I didn&apos;t want to miss the party.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>911</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s for us, after all.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>912</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Are they in costumes?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>913</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Who could tell?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>914</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>With all the crazy clothes they wear here.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>915</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Couldn&apos;t sleep, either?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>916</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Couldn&apos;t turn my mind off,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>917</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Thinking about your family?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>918</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>919</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>All I can do is wonder about tomorrow.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>920</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Which is pointless, of course.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>921</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I really am sorry about your hands.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>922</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It doesn&apos;t matter, Katniss,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>923</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ve never been a contender in these Games anyway.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>924</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That&apos;s no way to be thinking,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>925</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why not?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>926</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s true.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>927</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My best hope is to not disgrace myself and...</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>928</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And what?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>929</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I don&apos;t know how to say it exactly.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>930</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Only... I want to die as myself.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>931</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Does that make any sense?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>932</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I don&apos;t want them to change me in there.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>933</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Turn me into some kind of monster that I&apos;m not.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>934</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do you mean you won&apos;t kill anyone?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>935</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No, when the time comes, I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll kill just like everybody else.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>936</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I can&apos;t go down without a fight.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>937</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Only I keep wishing I could think of a way to... to show the Capitol they don&apos;t own me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>938</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That I&apos;m more than just a piece in their Games,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>939</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But you&apos;re not,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>940</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>None of us are.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>941</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That&apos;s how the Games work.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>942</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Okay, but within that framework, there&apos;s still you, there&apos;s still me,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>943</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Don&apos;t you see?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>944</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A little.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>945</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Only... no offense, but who cares, Peeta?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>946</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I do.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>947</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I mean, what else am I allowed to care about at this point?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>948</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Care about what Haymitch said.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>949</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>About staying alive.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>950</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Okay.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>951</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Thanks for the tip, sweetheart.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>952</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Look, if you want to spend the last hours of your life planning some noble death in the arena, that&apos;s your choice.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>953</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I want to spend mine in District Twelve.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>954</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Wouldn&apos;t surprise me if you do,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>955</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Give my mother my best when you make it back, will you?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>956</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Count on it,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>957</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The material in the jacket&apos;s designed to reflect body heat.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>958</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Expect some cool nights,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>959</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Where did you get that?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>960</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Off the green outfit you wore on the train,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>961</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s your district token, right?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>962</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It barely cleared the review board.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>963</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Some thought the pin could be used as a weapon, giving you an unfair advantage.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>964</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But eventually, they let it through,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>965</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They eliminated a ring from that District One girl, though.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>966</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If you twisted the gemstone, a spike popped out.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>967</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Poisoned one.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>968</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She claimed she had no knowledge the ring transformed and there was no way to prove she did.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>969</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But she lost her token.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>970</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There, you&apos;re all set.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>971</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Move around.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>972</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Make sure everything feels comfortable.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>973</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes, it&apos;s fine.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>974</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Fits perfectly.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>975</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Then there&apos;s nothing to do but wait for the call,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>976</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Unless you think you could eat any more?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>977</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do you want to talk, Katniss?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>978</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Remember what Haymitch said.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>979</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Run, find water.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>980</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The rest will follow,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>981</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And remember this.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>982</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m not allowed to bet, but if I could, my money would be on you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>983</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Truly?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>984</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Truly,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>985</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Good luck, girl on fire.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>986</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ladies and gentlemen, let the Seventy-fourth Hunger Games begin!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>987</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Just clear out, put as much distance as you can between yourselves and the others, and find a source of water.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>988</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Good to see you,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>989</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Come and get me!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>990</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Twelve down and eleven to go!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>991</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Better clear out so they can get the body before it starts stinking.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>992</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Shouldn&apos;t we have heard a cannon by now?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>993</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;d say yes.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>994</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Nothing to prevent them from going in immediately.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>995</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Unless she isn&apos;t dead.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>996</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She&apos;s dead.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>997</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I stuck her myself.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>998</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Then where&apos;s the cannon?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>999</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Someone should go back.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1000</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Make sure the job&apos;s done.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1001</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yeah, we don&apos;t want to have to track her down twice.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1002</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I said she&apos;s dead!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1003</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We&apos;re wasting time!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1004</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ll go finish her and let&apos;s move on!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1005</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Go on, then, Lover Boy,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1006</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>See for yourself.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1007</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why don&apos;t we just kill him now and get it over with?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1008</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Let him tag along.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1009</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What&apos;s the harm?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1010</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And he&apos;s handy with that knife.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1011</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Besides, he&apos;s our best chance of finding her.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1012</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>her</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1013</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1014</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You think she bought into that sappy romance stuff?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1015</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She might have.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1016</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Seemed pretty simpleminded to me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1017</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Every time I think about her spinning around in that dress, I want to puke.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1018</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Wish we knew how she got that eleven.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1019</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Bet you Lover Boy knows.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1020</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Was she dead?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1021</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1022</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But she is now,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1023</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ready to move on?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1024</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Move,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1025</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Water.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1026</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Katniss, the girl who was on fire.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1027</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How&apos;s everything with you?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1028</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well enough,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1029</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yourself?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1030</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s been a bit warm for my taste,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1031</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The air&apos;s better up here.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1032</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why don&apos;t you come on up?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1033</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Think I will,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1034</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Here, take this, Cato,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1035</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1036</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ll do better with my sword.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>Oh, let her stay up there.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1052</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1053</quoteindex>

		<quotetext>Live in the woods.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>1056</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You and I, we could make it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1057</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You know, they&apos;re not the only ones who can form alliances,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1058</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You want me for an ally?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1059</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why not?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1060</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You saved me with those tracker jackers.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1061</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;re smart enough to still be alive.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1062</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And I can&apos;t seem to shake you anyway,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1063</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You hungry?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1064</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Come on then, I&apos;ve had two kills today.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quotetext>I can fix your stings.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Can you?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1067</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1068</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Where&apos;d you find those?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1069</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Just around.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1070</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We all carry them when we work in the orchards.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1071</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They left a lot of nests there,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1072</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There are a lot here, too.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1073</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That&apos;s right.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1074</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;re District Eleven.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1075</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Agriculture,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1076</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Orchards, huh?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1077</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That must be how you can fly around the trees like you&apos;ve got wings.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1078</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well, come on, then.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1079</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Fix me up.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1080</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ohhh.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1081</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lucky you had the sense to pull the stingers out or you&apos;d be a lot worse.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1082</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do my neck!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1083</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do my cheek!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1084</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ve got something for that.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1085</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You have good sponsors,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1086</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Have you gotten anything yet?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1087</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You will, though.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1088</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Watch.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1089</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The closer we get to the end, the more people will realize how clever you are.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1090</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You weren&apos;t joking, about wanting me for an ally?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1091</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No, I meant it,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1092</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Okay,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1093</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s a deal.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1094</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1095</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ve never had a whole leg to myself before.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1096</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Take the other,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1097</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Really?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1098</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Take whatever you want.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1099</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Now that I&apos;ve got a bow and arrows, I can get more.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1100</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Plus I&apos;ve got snares.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1101</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I can show you how to set them,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1102</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, take it,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1103</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It will only keep a few days anyway, and we&apos;ve got the whole bird plus the rabbit.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1104</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;d have thought, in District Eleven, you&apos;d have a bit more to eat than us.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1105</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You know, since you grow the food,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1106</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, no, we&apos;re not allowed to eat the crops.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1107</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They arrest you or something?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1108</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They whip you and make everyone else watch,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1109</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The mayor&apos;s very strict about it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1110</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do you get all the coal you want?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1111</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1112</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Just what we buy and whatever we track in on our boots.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1113</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They feed us a bit extra during harvest, so that people can keep going longer,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1114</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Don&apos;t you have to be in school?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1115</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Not during harvest.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1116</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Everyone works then,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1117</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You sure this is safe?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1118</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, yes, we have them back home.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1119</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ve been eating them for days,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1120</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I know it&apos;s not much,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1121</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>but I had to get away from the Cornucopia fast.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1122</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You did just right,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1123</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How did you get those?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1124</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>In my pack.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1125</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They&apos;ve been useless so far.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1126</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They don&apos;t block the sun and they make it harder to see,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1127</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>These aren&apos;t for sun, they&apos;re for darkness,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1128</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Sometimes, when we harvest through the night, they&apos;ll pass out a few pairs to those of us highest in the trees.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1129</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Where the torchlight doesn&apos;t reach.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1130</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>One time, this boy Martin, he tried to keep his pair.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1131</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Hid it in his pants.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1132</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They killed him on the spot.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1133</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They killed a boy for taking these?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1134</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes, and everyone knew he was no danger.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1135</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Martin wasn&apos;t right in the head.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1136</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I mean, he still acted like a three-year-old.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1137</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He just wanted the glasses to play with,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1138</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So what do these do?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1139</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They let you see in complete darkness,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1140</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Try them tonight when the sun goes down.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1141</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Where do you sleep?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1142</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>In the trees?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1143</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>In just your jacket?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1144</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have these for my hands.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1145</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You can share my sleeping bag if you want.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1146</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We&apos;ll both easily fit.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1147</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Rue, I only woke up today.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1148</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How many nights did I miss?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1149</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Two,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1150</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The girls from Districts One and Four are dead.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1151</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There&apos;s ten of us left.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1152</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Something strange happened.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1153</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>At least, I think it did.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1154</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It might have been the tracker jacker venom making me imagine things,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1155</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You know the boy from my district?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1156</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Peeta?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1157</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I think he saved my life.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1158</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But he was with the Careers.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1159</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He&apos;s not with them now,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1160</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ve spied on their base camp by the lake.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1161</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They made it back before they collapsed from the stingers.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1162</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But he&apos;s not there.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1163</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Maybe he did save you and had to run.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1164</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If he did, it was all probably just part of his act.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1165</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You know, to make people think he&apos;s in love with me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1166</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1167</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I didn&apos;t think that was an act.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1168</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Course it is,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1169</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He worked it out with our mentor.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1170</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Let&apos;s try out these glasses.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1171</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I wonder who else got a pair of these,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1172</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The Careers have two pairs.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1173</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But they&apos;ve got everything down by the lake,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1174</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And they&apos;re so strong.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1175</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We&apos;re strong, too,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1176</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Just in a different way.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1177</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You are.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1178</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You can shoot,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1179</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What can I do?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1180</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You can feed yourself.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1181</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Can they?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1182</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They don&apos;t need to.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1183</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They have all those supplies,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1184</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Say they didn&apos;t.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1185</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Say the supplies were gone.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1186</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How long would they last?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1187</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I mean, it&apos;s the Hunger Games, right?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1188</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But, Katniss, they&apos;re not hungry,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1189</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No, they&apos;re not.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1190</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That&apos;s the problem,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1191</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I think we&apos;re going to have to fix that, Rue.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1192</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Who do you think that was?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1193</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I don&apos;t know.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1194</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It could have been any of the others,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1195</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I guess we&apos;ll know tonight.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1196</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Who&apos;s left again?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1197</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The boy from District One.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1198</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Both tributes from Two.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1199</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The boy from Three.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1200</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Thresh and me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1201</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And you and Peeta,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1202</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That&apos;s eight.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1203</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Wait, and the boy from Ten, the one with the bad leg.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1204</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He makes nine.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1205</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I wonder how that last one died,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1206</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What&apos;s in your hands?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1207</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Breakfast,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1208</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What kind are those?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1209</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Not sure.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1210</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There&apos;s a marshy area over that way.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Some kind of waterbird,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1212</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ready to do it?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1213</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do what?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1214</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Today we take out the Careers’ food,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1215</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Really?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1216</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1217</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No idea.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1218</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Come on, we&apos;ll figure out a plan while we hunt,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1219</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The boy from District Three?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1220</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He&apos;s working with them?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1221</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes, he stays at the camp full-time.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1222</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He got stung, too, when they drew the tracker jackers in by the lake,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1223</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I guess they agreed to let him live if he acted as their guard.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1224</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But he&apos;s not very big.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1225</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What weapons does he have?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1226</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Not much that I could see.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1227</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A spear.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1228</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He might be able to hold a few of us off with that, but Thresh could kill him easily,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1229</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And the food&apos;s just out in the open?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1230</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Something&apos;s not quite right about that whole setup.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1231</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I know.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1232</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But I couldn&apos;t tell what exactly,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1233</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Katniss, even if you could get to the food, how would you get rid of it?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1234</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Burn it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1235</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Dump it in the lake.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1236</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Soak it in fuel.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1237</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Eat it!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1238</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Don&apos;t worry, I&apos;ll think of something.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1239</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Destroying things is much easier than making them.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1240</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Music.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1241</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Music?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1242</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You have a lot of time for that?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1243</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We sing at home.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1244</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>At work, too.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1245</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That&apos;s why I love your pin,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1246</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You have mockingjays?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1247</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, yes.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1248</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I have a few that are my special friends.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1249</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We can sing back and forth for hours.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1250</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They carry messages for me,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1251</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What do you mean?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1252</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m usually up highest, so I&apos;m the first to see the flag that signals quitting time.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1253</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There&apos;s a special little song I do,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1254</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And the mockingjays spread it around the orchard.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1255</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That&apos;s how everyone knows to knock off,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1256</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They can be dangerous though, if you get too near their nests.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1257</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But you can&apos;t blame them for that.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1258</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Here, you take it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1259</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It has more meaning for you than me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1260</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, no,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1261</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I like to see it on you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1262</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That&apos;s how I decided I could trust you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1263</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Besides, I have this.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1264</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s a good luck charm.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1265</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well, it&apos;s worked so far,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1266</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Maybe you should just stick with that.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1267</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What about you?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1268</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Won&apos;t you be cold?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1269</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Not if I pick up another bag down by the lake,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1270</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You know, stealing isn&apos;t illegal here,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1271</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It might not work.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1272</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But if you hear the mockingjays singing it, you&apos;ll know I&apos;m okay, only I can&apos;t get back right away.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1273</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Are there many mockingjays here?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1274</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Haven&apos;t you seen them?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1275</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They&apos;ve got nests everywhere,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1276</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Okay, then.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1277</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If all goes according to plan, I&apos;ll see you for dinner,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1278</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You be careful,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1279</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You, too,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1280</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He&apos;s coming.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1281</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We need him in the woods, and his job&apos;s done here anyway.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1282</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No one can touch those supplies,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1283</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What about Lover Boy?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1284</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I keep telling you, forget about him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1285</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I know where I cut him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1286</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s a miracle he hasn&apos;t bled to death yet.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1287</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>At any rate, he&apos;s in no shape to raid us,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1288</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Come on,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1289</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>When we find her, I kill her in my own way, and no one interferes.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1290</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s mined,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Don&apos;t go.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1304</quoteindex>

		<quotetext>Staying right here,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Sing,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1307</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Only I keep wishing I could think of a way to... to show the Capital they don&apos;t own me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1308</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That I&apos;m more than just a piece in their Games.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1309</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Bye, Rue,</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1310</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Good and safe,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>My thanks to the people of District Eleven,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Now you have to drink water, Katniss.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>Now you have to sort the packs, Katniss.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>Close your eyes again,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1326</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I guess all those hours decorating cakes paid off.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1327</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes, frosting.</quotetext>

	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1339</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lean down a minute first,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1340</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Need to tell you something.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1341</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Remember, we&apos;re madly in love, so it&apos;s all right to kiss me anytime you feel like it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1342</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Thanks, I&apos;ll keep it in mind.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1343</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Look, Peeta, I&apos;m going to roll you into the stream.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1344</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s very shallow here, okay?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1345</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Excellent,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1346</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>On three,</quotetext>

		<quotetext>One, two, three!</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>1348</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Okay, change of plans.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1349</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m not going to put you all the way in,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1350</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No more rolling?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1351</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That&apos;s all done.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1352</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Let&apos;s get you cleaned up.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1353</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Keep an eye on the woods for me, okay?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1354</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Swallow these,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1355</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You must be hungry.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1356</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Not really.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1357</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s funny, I haven&apos;t been hungry for days,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1358</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Peeta, we need to get some food in you,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1359</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;ll just come right back up,</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1360</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Thanks.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1361</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m much better, really.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>1362</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Can I sleep now, Katniss?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1363</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Soon,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1364</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I need to look at your leg first.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1365</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Pretty awful, huh?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1366</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So-so.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1367</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You should see some of the people they bring my mother from the mines.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1368</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>First thing is to clean it well.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1369</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why don&apos;t we give it some air and then...</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1370</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And then you&apos;ll patch it up?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1371</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That&apos;s right,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1372</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>In the meantime, you eat these.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1373</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We&apos;re going to have to experiment some,</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>1376</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Something wrong?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>I... I&apos;m no good at this.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1378</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m not my mother.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>1384</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Killing things is much easier than this,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1385</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Although for all I know, I am killing you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1386</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Can you speed it up a little?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1387</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1388</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Shut up and eat your pears,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1389</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What next, Dr.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1390</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Everdeen?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1391</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Maybe I&apos;ll put some of the burn ointment on it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1392</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I think it helps with infection anyway.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1393</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And wrap it up?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1394</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Here, cover yourself with this and I&apos;ll wash your shorts.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1395</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, I don&apos;t care if you see me,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1396</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;re just like the rest of my family,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1397</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I care, all right?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1398</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You know, you&apos;re kind of squeamish for such a lethal person,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1399</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I wish I&apos;d let you give Haymitch a shower after all.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1400</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What&apos;s he sent you so far?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1401</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Not a thing,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1402</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why, did you get something?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1403</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Burn medicine,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1404</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, and some bread.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1405</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I always knew you were his favorite,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1406</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Please, he can&apos;t stand being in the same room with me,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1407</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Because you&apos;re just alike,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1408</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Peeta, we&apos;ve got to go now.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1409</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Go?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1410</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Go where?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1411</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Away from here.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1412</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Downstream maybe.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1413</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Somewhere we can hide you until you&apos;re stronger,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1414</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Come on.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1415</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You can do this.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1416</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Katniss,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1417</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Thanks for finding me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1418</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You would have found me if you could,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1419</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1420</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Look, if I don&apos;t make it back—</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1421</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Don&apos;t talk like that.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1422</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I didn&apos;t drain all that pus for nothing,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1423</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I know.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1424</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But just in case I don&apos;t—</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1425</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No, Peeta, I don&apos;t even want to discuss it,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1426</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But I—</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1427</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;re not going to die.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1428</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I forbid it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1429</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>All right?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1430</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>All right,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1431</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;re supposed to be in love, sweetheart.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1432</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The boy&apos;s dying.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1433</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Give me something I can work with!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1434</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Peeta!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1435</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Peeta, look what Haymitch has sent you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1436</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I woke up and you were gone,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1437</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I was worried about you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1438</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You were worried about me?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1439</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Have you taken a look at yourself lately?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1440</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I thought Cato and Clove might have found you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1441</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They like to hunt at night,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1442</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Clove?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1443</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Which one is that?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1444</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The girl from District Two.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1445</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She&apos;s still alive, right?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1446</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes, there&apos;s just them and us and Thresh and Foxface,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1447</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That&apos;s what I nicknamed the girl from Five.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1448</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How do you feel?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1449</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Better than yesterday.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1450</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This is an enormous improvement over the mud,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1451</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Clean clothes and medicine and a sleeping bag... and you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1452</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No more kisses for you until you&apos;ve eaten,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1453</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You didn&apos;t sleep,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1454</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m all right,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1455</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Sleep now.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1456</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ll keep watch.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1457</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ll wake you if anything happens,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1458</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Katniss, you can&apos;t stay up forever.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1459</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>All right,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1460</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But just for a few hours.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1461</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Then you wake me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1462</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Go to sleep,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1463</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Peeta, you were supposed to wake me after a couple of hours,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1464</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>For what?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1465</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Nothing&apos;s going on here,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1466</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Besides I like watching you sleep.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1467</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You don&apos;t scowl.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1468</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Improves your looks a lot.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1469</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well, there&apos;s more swelling, but the pus is gone,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1470</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I know what blood poisoning is, Katniss,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1471</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Even if my mother isn&apos;t a healer.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1472</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;re just going to have to outlast the others, Peeta.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1473</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They&apos;ll cure it back at the Capitol when we win,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1474</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes, that&apos;s a good plan,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1475</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You have to eat.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1476</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Keep your strength up.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1477</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m going to make you soup,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1478</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Don&apos;t light a fire,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1479</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s not worth it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1480</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We&apos;ll see,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1481</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do you want anything?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1482</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1483</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Thank you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1484</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Wait, yes.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1485</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Tell me a story.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1486</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A story?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1487</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What about?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1488</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Something happy.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1489</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Tell me about the happiest day you can remember,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1490</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Did I ever tell you about how I got Prim&apos;s goat?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1491</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Gale,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1492</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I want that goat for Prim.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1493</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She&apos;s hurt pretty bad,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1494</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We better take a closer look.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1495</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Let her be,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1496</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Just looking,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1497</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well, look fast.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1498</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She goes to the butcher soon.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1499</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Hardly anyone will buy her milk, and then they only pay half price,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1500</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What&apos;s the butcher giving for her?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1501</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Hang around and see.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1502</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lucky thing you showed up,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1503</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Girl&apos;s got her eye on your goat.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1504</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Not if she&apos;s spoken for,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1505</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She&apos;s not.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1506</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Look at that shoulder.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1507</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Bet you half the carcass will be too rotten for even sausage.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1508</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1509</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We had a deal.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1510</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We had a deal on an animal with a few teeth marks.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1511</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Not that thing.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1512</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Sell her to the girl if she&apos;s stupid enough to take her,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1513</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They sound like you,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1514</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, no, Peeta.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1515</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They work magic.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1516</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That thing couldn&apos;t have died if it tried,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1517</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Don&apos;t worry.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1518</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m not trying,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1519</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Finish the story.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1520</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well, that&apos;s it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1521</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Only I remember that night, Prim insisted on sleeping with Lady on a blanket next to the fire.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1522</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And just before they drifted off, the goat licked her cheek, like it was giving her a good night kiss or something,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1523</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It was already mad about her.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1524</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Was it still wearing the pink ribbon?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1525</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I think so,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1526</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1527</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m just trying to get a picture,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1528</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I can see why that day made you happy.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1529</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well, I knew that goat would be a little gold mine,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1530</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes, of course I was referring to that, not the lasting joy you gave the sister you love so much you took her place in the reaping,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1531</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The goat has paid for itself.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1532</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Several times over,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1533</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well, it wouldn&apos;t dare do anything else after you saved its life,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1534</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I intend to do the same thing.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1535</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Really?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1536</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What did you cost me again?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1537</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A lot of trouble.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1538</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Don&apos;t worry.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1539</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;ll get it all back,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1540</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;re not making sense,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1541</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;re a little cooler though.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1542</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Now hold on.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1543</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Some of you may already be declining my invitation.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1544</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But this is no ordinary feast.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1545</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Each of you needs something desperately.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1546</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Each of you will find that something in a backpack, marked with your district number, at the Cornucopia at dawn.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1547</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Think hard about refusing to show up.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1548</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>For some of you, this will be your last chance,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1549</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1550</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;re not risking your life for me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1551</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Who said I was?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1552</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So, you&apos;re not going?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1553</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Of course, I&apos;m not going.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1554</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Give me some credit.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>1580</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ve brought you a treat.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1581</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I found a new patch of berries a little farther downstream.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>1582</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They&apos;re very sweet.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>1586</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1587</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But they taste familiar.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1588</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Sugar berries?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1589</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well, you can&apos;t get them in the market much, they only grow wild,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1590</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They&apos;re sweet as syrup,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1591</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Syrup.</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>1592</quoteindex>

		<quotetext>You&apos;ve probably got him strapped up in some tree while you try to keep his heart going.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1602</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What&apos;s in the pretty little backpack?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1603</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That medicine for Lover Boy?</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>1604</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Too bad he&apos;ll never get it.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Just like we did your pathetic little ally... what was her name?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1609</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The one who hopped around in the trees?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1610</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Rue?</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>1611</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well, first Rue, then you, and then I think we&apos;ll just let nature take care of Lover Boy.</quotetext>

	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1612</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How does that sound?</quotetext>

		<quotetext>Now, where to start?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1614</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I think...</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1615</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I think we&apos;ll start with your mouth.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1616</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes, I don&apos;t think you&apos;ll have much use for your lips anymore.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1617</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Want to blow Lover Boy one last kiss?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1618</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>All right then.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1619</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Let&apos;s get started.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1620</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What&apos;d you do to that little girl?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1621</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You kill her?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1622</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No!</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>1623</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No, it wasn&apos;t me!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1624</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You said her name.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1625</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I heard you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1626</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You kill her?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1627</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You cut her up like you were going to cut up this girl here?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1628</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No!</quotetext>
	</quote>

		<quoteindex>1629</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No, I—</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1630</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Cato!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>

		<quotetext>Cato!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1632</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Clove!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1633</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What&apos;d she mean?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1634</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>About Rue being your ally?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1635</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I—I—we teamed up.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1636</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Blew up the supplies.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1637</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I tried to save her, I did.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1638</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But he got there first.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1639</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>District One,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1640</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And you killed him?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1641</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1642</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I killed him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1643</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And buried her in flowers,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1644</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And I sang her to sleep.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1645</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>To sleep?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1646</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>To death.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1647</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I sang until she died,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1648</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your district... they sent me bread.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1649</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do it fast, okay, Thresh?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1650</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Just this one time, I let you go.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1651</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>For the little girl.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1652</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You and me, we&apos;re even then.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1653</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No more owed.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1654</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You understand?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1655</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Clove!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1656</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You better run now, Fire Girl,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1657</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Katniss,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1658</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Katniss, can you hear me?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1659</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Peeta.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1660</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Hey,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1661</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Good to see your eyes again.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1662</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How long have I been out?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1663</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Not sure.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1664</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I woke up yesterday evening and you were lying next to me in a very scary pool of blood,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1665</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I think it&apos;s stopped finally, but I wouldn&apos;t sit up or anything.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1666</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;re better,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1667</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Much better.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1668</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Whatever you shot into my arm did the trick,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1669</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>By this morning, almost all the swelling in my leg was gone.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1670</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Did you eat?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1671</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m sorry to say I gobbled down three pieces of that groosling before I realized it might have to last a while.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1672</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Don&apos;t worry, I&apos;m back on a strict diet,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1673</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No, it&apos;s good.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1674</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You need to eat.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1675</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ll go hunting soon,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1676</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Not too soon, all right?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1677</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You just let me take care of you for a while.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1678</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your boots and socks are still damp and the weather&apos;s not helping much,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1679</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I wonder what brought on this storm?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1680</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I mean, who&apos;s the target?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1681</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Cato and Thresh,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1682</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Foxface will be in her den somewhere, and Clove... she cut me an then...</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1683</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I know Clove&apos;s dead.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1684</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I saw it in the sky last night,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1685</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Did you kill her?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1686</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1687</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Thresh broke her skull with a rock,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1688</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Lucky he didn&apos;t catch you, too,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1689</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He did.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1690</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But he let me go.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1691</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He let you go because he didn&apos;t want to owe you anything?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1692</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1693</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I don&apos;t expect you to understand it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1694</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;ve always had enough.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1695</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But if you&apos;d lived in the Seam, I wouldn&apos;t have to explain,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1696</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And don&apos;t try.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1697</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Obviously I&apos;m too dim to get it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1698</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s like the bread.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1699</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How I never seem to get over owing you for that,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1700</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The bread?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1701</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1702</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>From when we were kids?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1703</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I think we can let that go.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1704</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I mean, you just brought me back from the dead.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1705</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But you didn&apos;t know me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1706</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We had never even spoken.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1707</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Besides, it&apos;s the first gift that&apos;s always the hardest to pay back.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1708</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I wouldn&apos;t even have been here to do it if you hadn&apos;t helped me then,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1709</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why did you, anyway?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1710</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1711</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You know why,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1712</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Haymitch said you would take a lot of convincing.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1713</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Haymitch?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1714</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What&apos;s he got to do with it?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1715</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Nothing,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1716</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So, Cato and Thresh, huh?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1717</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I guess it&apos;s too much to hope that they&apos;ll simultaneously destroy each other?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1718</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I think we would like Thresh.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1719</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I think he&apos;d be our friend back in District Twelve,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1720</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Then let&apos;s hope Cato kills him, so we don&apos;t have to,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1721</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What is it?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1722</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Are you in a lot of pain?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1723</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I want to go home, Peeta,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1724</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You will.</quotetext>

		<quoteindex>1725</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I promise,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1726</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I want to go home now,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1727</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Tell you what.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1728</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You go back to sleep and dream of home.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1729</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And you&apos;ll be there for real before you know it,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1730</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Okay?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1731</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Okay,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1732</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Wake me if you need me to keep watch.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1733</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m good and rested, thanks to you and Haymitch.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1734</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Besides, who knows how long this will last?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1735</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Should we try and ration it?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1736</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No, let&apos;s just finish it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1737</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The groosling&apos;s getting old anyway, and the last thing we need is to get sick off spoilt food,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1738</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Tomorrow&apos;s a hunting day,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1739</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I won&apos;t be much help with that,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1740</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ve never hunted before.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1741</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ll kill and you cook,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1742</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And you can always gather.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1743</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I wish there was some sort of bread bush out there,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1744</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The bread they sent me from District Eleven was still warm,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1745</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Here, chew these.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1746</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Where did Thresh go?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1747</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I mean, what&apos;s on the far side of the circle?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1748</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>A field.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1749</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>As far as you can see it&apos;s full of grasses as high as my shoulders.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1750</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I don&apos;t know, maybe some of them are grain.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1751</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There are patches of different colors.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1752</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But there are no paths,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1753</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I bet some of them are grain.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1754</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I bet Thresh knows which ones, too,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1755</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Did you go in there?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1756</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1757</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Nobody really wanted to track Thresh down in that grass.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1758</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It has a sinister feeling to it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1759</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Every time I look at that field, all I can think of are hidden things.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1760</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Snakes, and rabid animals, and quicksand,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1761</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There could be anything in there.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1762</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Maybe there is a bread bush in that field,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1763</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Maybe that&apos;s why Thresh looks better fed now than when we started the Games.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1764</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Either that or he&apos;s got very generous sponsors,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1765</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I wonder what we&apos;d have to do to get Haymitch to send us some bread.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1766</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well, he probably used up a lot of resources helping me knock you out,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1767</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yeah, about that,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1768</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Don&apos;t try something like that again.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1769</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Or what?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1770</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Or... or...</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1771</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Just give me a minute.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1772</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What&apos;s the problem?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1773</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The problem is we&apos;re both still alive.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1774</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Which only reinforces the idea in your mind that you did the right thing,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1775</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I did do the right thing,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1776</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1777</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Just don&apos;t, Katniss!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1778</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Don&apos;t die for me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1779</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You won&apos;t be doing me any favors.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1780</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>All right?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1781</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Maybe I did it for myself, Peeta, did you ever think of that?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1782</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Maybe you aren&apos;t the only one who... who worries about... what it would be like if...</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1783</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If what, Katniss?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1784</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That&apos;s exactly the kind of topic Haymitch told me to steer clear of,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1785</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Then I&apos;ll just have to fill in the blanks myself,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1786</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I think your wound is bleeding again.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1787</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Come on, lie down, it&apos;s bedtime anyway,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1788</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Tomorrow, when it&apos;s dry, I&apos;ll find us a place so high in the trees we can both sleep in peace,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1789</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Peeta,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1790</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You said at the interview you&apos;d had a crush on me forever.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1791</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>When did forever start?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1792</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, let&apos;s see.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1793</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I guess the first day of school.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1794</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We were five.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1795</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You had on a red plaid dress and your hair... it was in two braids instead of one.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1796</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My father pointed you out when we were waiting to line up,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1797</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your father?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1798</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1799</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He said, ‘See that little girl?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1800</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I wanted to marry her mother, but she ran off with a coal miner,’</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1801</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1802</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;re making that up!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1803</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No, true story,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1804</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And I said, ‘A coal miner?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1805</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why did she want a coal miner if she could&apos;ve had you?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1806</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>’ And he said, ‘Because when he sings... even the birds stop to listen.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1807</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That&apos;s true.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1808</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They do.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1809</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I mean, they did,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1810</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So that day, in music assembly, the teacher asked who knew the valley song.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1811</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your hand shot right up in the air.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1812</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>She stood you up on a stool and had you sing it for us.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1813</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And I swear, every bird outside the windows fell silent,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1814</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, please,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1815</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No, it happened.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1816</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And right when your song ended, I knew—just like your mother—I was a goner,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1817</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Then for the next eleven years, I tried to work up the nerve to talk to you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1818</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Without success,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1819</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Without success.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1820</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So, in a way, my name being drawn in the reaping was a real piece of luck,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1821</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You have a... remarkable memory,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1822</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I remember everything about you,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1823</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;re the one who wasn&apos;t paying attention.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1824</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I am now,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1825</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well, I don&apos;t have much competition here,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1826</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Say it!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1827</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Say it!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1828</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You don&apos;t have much competition anywhere.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1829</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I guess Haymitch finally got tired of watching us starve.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1830</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I guess so,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1831</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes, that&apos;s what I&apos;m looking lot, sweetheart.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1832</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We better take it slow on that stew.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1833</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Remember the first night on the train?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1834</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The rich food made me sick and I wasn&apos;t even starving then.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1835</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;re right.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1836</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And I could just inhale the whole thing!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1837</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I want more.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1838</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Me, too.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1839</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Tell you what.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1840</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We wait an hour, if it stays down, then we get another serving,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1841</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Agreed,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1842</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s going to be a long hour.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1843</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Maybe not that long,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1844</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What was that you were saying just before the food arrived?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1845</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Something about me... no competition... best thing that ever happened to you...</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1846</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I don&apos;t remember that last part,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1847</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, that&apos;s right.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1848</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That&apos;s what I was thinking,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1849</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Scoot over, I&apos;m freezing.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1850</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So, since we were five, you never even noticed any other girls?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1851</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No, I noticed just about every girl, but none of them made a lasting impression but you,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1852</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m sure that would thrill your parents, you liking a girl from the Seam,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1853</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Hardly.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1854</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But I couldn&apos;t care less.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1855</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Anyway, if we make it back, you won&apos;t be a girl from the Seam, you&apos;ll be a girl from the Victor&apos;s Village,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1856</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But then, our only neighbor will be Haymitch!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1857</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ah, that&apos;ll be nice,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1858</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You and me and Haymitch.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1859</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Very cozy.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1860</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Picnics, birthdays, long winter nights around the fire retelling old Hunger Games’ tales.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1861</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I told you, he hates me!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1862</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Only sometimes.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1863</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>When he&apos;s sober, I&apos;ve never heard him say one negative thing about you,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1864</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He&apos;s never sober!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1865</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That&apos;s right.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1866</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Who am I thinking of?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1867</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, I know.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1868</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s Cinna who likes you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1869</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But that&apos;s mainly because you didn&apos;t try to run when he set you on fire,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1870</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>On the other hand, Haymitch... well, if I were you, I&apos;d avoid Haymitch completely.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1871</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He hates you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1872</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I thought you said I was his favorite,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1873</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He hates me more,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1874</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I don&apos;t think people in general are his sort of thing.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1875</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How do you think he did it?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1876</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Who?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1877</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Did what?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1878</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Haymitch.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1879</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How do you think he won the Games?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1880</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He outsmarted the others,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1881</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There won&apos;t be anything to see tonight,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1882</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Nothing&apos;s happened or we would&apos;ve heard a cannon.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1883</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Katniss,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1884</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1885</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Should we split another roll, too?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1886</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Katniss,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1887</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m going to split one.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1888</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But I&apos;ll save the cheese for tomorrow,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1889</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1890</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Thresh is dead,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1891</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He can&apos;t be,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1892</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They must have fired the cannon during the thunder and we missed it,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1893</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Are you sure?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1894</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I mean, it&apos;s pouring buckets out there.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1895</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I don&apos;t know how you can see anything,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1896</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You all right?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1897</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s just... if we didn&apos;t win... I wanted Thresh to.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1898</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Because he let me go.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1899</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And because of Rue.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1900</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yeah, I know,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1901</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But this means we&apos;re one step closer to District Twelve.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1902</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Eat.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1903</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s still warm.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1904</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It also means Cato will be back hunting us.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1905</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And he&apos;s got supplies again,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1906</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He&apos;ll be wounded, I bet,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1907</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What makes you say that?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1908</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Because Thresh would have never gone down without a fight.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1909</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He&apos;s so strong, I mean, he was.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1910</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And they were in his territory,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1911</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Good,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1912</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The more wounded Cato is the better.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1913</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I wonder how Foxface is making out.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1914</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, she&apos;s fine,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1915</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Probably be easier to catch Cato than her.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1916</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Maybe they&apos;ll catch each other and we can just go home,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1917</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But we better be extra careful about the watches.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1918</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I dozed off a few times.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1919</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Me, too,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1920</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But not tonight.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1921</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Don&apos;t be mad,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1922</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I had to eat again.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1923</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Here&apos;s your half.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1924</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, good,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1925</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Mm.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1926</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We make a goat cheese and apple tart at the bakery,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1927</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Bet that&apos;s expensive,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1928</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Too expensive for my family to eat.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1929</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Unless it&apos;s gone very stale.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1930</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Of course, practically everything we eat is stale,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1931</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But you won&apos;t be alone,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1932</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We&apos;re wasting hunting time,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1933</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I wouldn&apos;t call it wasting,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1934</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So do we hunt on empty stomachs to give us an edge?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1935</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Not us,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1936</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We stuff ourselves to give us staying power.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1937</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Count me in,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1938</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>All this?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1939</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We&apos;ll earn it back today,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1940</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I can feel Effie Trinket shuddering at my manners.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1941</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Hey, Effie, watch this!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1942</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We miss you, Effie!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1943</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Stop!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1944</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Cato could be right outside our cave.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1945</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What do I care?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1946</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ve got you to protect me now,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1947</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Come on,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1948</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He&apos;ll be hunting us by now,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1949</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Cato isn&apos;t one to wait for his prey to wander by.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1950</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If he&apos;s wounded—</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1951</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It won&apos;t matter,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1952</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If he can move, he&apos;s coming.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1953</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If we want food, we better head back up to my old hunting grounds,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1954</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your call.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1955</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Just tell me what you need me to do,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1956</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Keep an eye out,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1957</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Stay on the rocks as much as possible, no sense in leaving him tracks to follow.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1958</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And listen for both of us.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1959</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1960</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;ve got to move more quietly,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1961</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Forget about Cato, you&apos;re chasing off every rabbit in a ten-mile radius.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1962</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Really?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1963</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Sorry, I didn&apos;t know.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1964</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Can you take your boots off?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1965</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Here?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1966</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1967</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I will, too.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1968</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That way we&apos;ll both be quieter.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1969</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Katniss,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1970</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We need to split up.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1971</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I know I&apos;m chasing away the game.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1972</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Only because your leg&apos;s hurt,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1973</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I know,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1974</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So, why don&apos;t you go on?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1975</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Show me some plants to gather and that way we&apos;ll both be useful.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1976</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Not if Cato comes and kills you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1977</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Look, I can handle Cato.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1978</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I fought him before, didn&apos;t I?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1979</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What if you climbed up in a tree and acted as a lookout while I hunted?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1980</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What if you show me what&apos;s edible around here and go get us some meat?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1981</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Just don&apos;t go far, in case you need help.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1982</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Peeta!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1983</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Peeta!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1984</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What are you doing?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1985</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;re supposed to be here, not running around in the woods!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1986</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I found some berries down by the stream,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1987</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I whistled.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1988</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why didn&apos;t you whistle back?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1989</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I didn&apos;t hear.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1990</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The water&apos;s too loud, I guess,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1991</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I thought Cato killed you!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1992</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No, I&apos;m fine.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1993</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Katniss?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1994</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If two people agree on a signal, they stay in range.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1995</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Because if one of them doesn&apos;t answer, they&apos;re in trouble, all right?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1996</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>All right!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1997</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>All right.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1998</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Because that&apos;s what happened with Rue, and I watched her die!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>1999</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And you ate without me!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2000</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2001</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No, I didn&apos;t,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2002</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, and I suppose the apples ate the cheese,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2003</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I don&apos;t know what ate the cheese,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2004</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>but it wasn&apos;t me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2005</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ve been down by the stream collecting berries.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2006</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Would you care for some?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2007</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Not these, Katniss.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2008</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Never these.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2009</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They&apos;re nightlock.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2010</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;ll be dead before they reach your stomach.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2011</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Climb.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2012</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He&apos;ll be here in a second.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2013</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We&apos;ll stand a better chance fighting him from above.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2014</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No, Peeta, she&apos;s your kill, not Cato&apos;s.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2015</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2016</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I haven&apos;t even seen her since the first day,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2017</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How could I have killed her?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2018</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I wonder how she found us,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2019</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My fault, I guess, if I&apos;m as loud as you say.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2020</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And she&apos;s very clever, Peeta.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2021</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well, she was.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2022</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Until you outfoxed her.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2023</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Not on purpose.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2024</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Doesn&apos;t seem fair somehow.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2025</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I mean, we would have both been dead, too, if she hadn&apos;t eaten the berries first.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2026</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No, of course, we wouldn&apos;t.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2027</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You recognized them, didn&apos;t you?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2028</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We call them nightlock.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2029</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Even the name sounds deadly,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2030</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m sorry, Katniss.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2031</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I really thought they were the same ones you&apos;d gathered.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2032</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Don&apos;t apologize.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2033</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It just means we&apos;re one step closer to home, right?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2034</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ll get rid of the rest,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2035</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Wait!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2036</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If they fooled Foxface, maybe they can fool Cato as well.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2037</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If he&apos;s chasing us or something, we can act like we accidentally drop the pouch and if he eats them—</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2038</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Then hello District Twelve,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2039</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That&apos;s it,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2040</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He&apos;ll know where we are now,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2041</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If he was anywhere nearby and saw that hovercraft, he&apos;ll know we killed her and come after us.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2042</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Let&apos;s make a fire.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2043</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Right now.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2044</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Are you ready to face him?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2045</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m ready to eat.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2046</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Better to cook our food while we have the chance.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2047</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If he knows we&apos;re here, he knows.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2048</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But he also knows there&apos;s two of us and probably assumes we were hunting Foxface.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2049</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That means you&apos;re recovered.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2050</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>And the fire means we&apos;re not hiding, we&apos;re inviting him here.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2051</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Would you show up?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2052</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Maybe not,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2053</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I can&apos;t climb like you, Katniss, especially with my leg, and I don&apos;t think I could ever fall asleep fifty feet above the ground.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2054</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s not safe to stay in the open, Peeta,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2055</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Can&apos;t we go back to the cave?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2056</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s near water and easy to defend.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2057</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Sure.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2058</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Let&apos;s go back to the cave.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2059</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well, that was easy.</quotetext>

		<quotetext>I slept the whole night.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2061</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That&apos;s not fair, Katniss, you should have woken me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2062</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;ll sleep now.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2063</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Wake me if anything interesting happens.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2064</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Any sign of our friend?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2065</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No, he&apos;s keeping a disturbingly low profile.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2066</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How long do you think we&apos;ll have before the Gamemakers drive us together?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2067</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well, Foxface died almost a day ago, so there&apos;s been plenty of time for the audience to place bets and get bored.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2068</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I guess it could happen at any moment,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2069</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yeah, I have a feeling today&apos;s the day,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2070</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I wonder how they&apos;ll do it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2071</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well, until they do, no sense in wasting a hunting day.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2072</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But we should probably eat as much as we can hold just in case we run into trouble,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2073</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Not even a little damp.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2074</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They must have drained it while we slept,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2075</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The lake,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2076</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That&apos;s where they want us to go.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2077</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Maybe the ponds still have some,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2078</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We can check,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2079</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;re right.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2080</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They&apos;re driving us to the lake,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2081</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do you want to go straightaway or wait until the water&apos;s tapped out?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2082</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Let&apos;s go now, while we&apos;ve had food and rest.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2083</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Let&apos;s just go end this thing,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2084</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Two against one.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2085</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Should be a piece of cake,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2086</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Next time we eat, it will be in the Capitol,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2087</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You bet it will,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2088</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Let&apos;s move on,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2089</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We don&apos;t want to fight him after dark.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2090</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>There&apos;s only the one pair of glasses.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2091</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Maybe that&apos;s what he&apos;s waiting for.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2092</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What do you want to do?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2093</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Go back to the cave?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2094</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Either that or find a tree.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2095</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But let&apos;s give him another half an hour or so.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2096</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Then we&apos;ll take cover,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2097</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Just like your father,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2098</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That&apos;s Rue&apos;s song,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2099</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I think they remember it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2100</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He&apos;s got some kind of body armor!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2101</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Go, Katniss!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2102</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Go!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2103</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Climb!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2104</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2105</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He said, ‘Can they climb it?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2106</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Katniss?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2107</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s her!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2108</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Who?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2109</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What is it, Katniss?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2110</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s them.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2111</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s all of them.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2112</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The others.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2113</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Rue and Foxface and .</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2114</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>all of the other tributes,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2115</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What did they do to them?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2116</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You don&apos;t think... those could be their real eyes?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2117</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Kill it, Peeta!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2118</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Kill it!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2119</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Shoot me and he goes down with me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2120</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Don&apos;t go to sleep,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2121</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Are you cold?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2122</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Cato may win this thing yet,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2123</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Don&apos;t you believe it,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2124</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why don&apos;t they just kill him?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2125</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You know why,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2126</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I think he&apos;s closer now.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2127</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Katniss, can you shoot him?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2128</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>My last arrow&apos;s in your tourniquet,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2129</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Make it count,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2130</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Did you get him?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2131</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Then we won, Katniss,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2132</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Hurray for us,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2133</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Hey!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2134</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What&apos;s going on?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2135</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Maybe it&apos;s the body.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2136</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Maybe we have to move away from it,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2137</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Okay.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2138</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Think you could make it to the lake?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2139</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Think I better try,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2140</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What are they waiting for?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2141</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I don&apos;t know,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2142</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Greetings to the final contestants of the Seventy-fourth Hunger Games.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2143</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The earlier revision has been revoked.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2144</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Closer examination of the rule book has disclosed that only one winner may be allowed,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2145</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Good luck and may the odds be ever in your favor.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2146</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>If you think about it, it&apos;s not that surprising,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2147</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2148</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2149</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I won&apos;t.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2150</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Do it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2151</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Before they send those mutts back or something.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2152</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I don&apos;t want to die like Cato,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2153</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Then you shoot me,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2154</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You shoot me and go home and live with it!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2155</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You know I can&apos;t,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2156</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Fine, I&apos;ll go first anyway.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2157</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No, you can&apos;t kill yourself,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2158</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Katniss,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2159</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s what I want.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2160</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;re not leaving me here alone,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2161</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Listen,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2162</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We both know they have to have a victor.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2163</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It can only be one of us.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2164</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Please, take it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2165</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>For me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2166</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No, I won&apos;t let you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2167</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Trust me,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2168</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>On the count of three?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2169</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The count of three,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2170</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Hold them out.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2171</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I want everyone to see,</quotetext>

	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2177</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to present the victors of the Seventy-fourth Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2178</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I give you—the tributes of District Twelve!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2179</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You didn&apos;t swallow any?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2180</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2181</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Guess I&apos;d be dead by now if I did,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2182</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Did Peeta make it?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2183</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Peeta!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2184</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Nice job, sweetheart,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2185</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Where&apos;s Portia?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2186</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Is she with Peeta?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2187</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He is all right, isn&apos;t he?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2188</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I mean, he&apos;s alive?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2189</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He&apos;s fine.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2190</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Only they want to do your reunion live on air at the ceremony,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2191</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2192</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>That&apos;s all,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2193</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I guess I&apos;d want to see that myself.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2194</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Go on with Cinna.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2195</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He has to get you ready,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2196</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No, no, no.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2197</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They don&apos;t want it all coming back up on the stage,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2198</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, they did a full body polish on you,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2199</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Not a flaw left on your skin.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2200</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I was still in bed!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2201</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I had just had my eyebrows dyed!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2202</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I swear I nearly fainted!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2203</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Have you given up the whole ‘girl on fire’ thing?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2204</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You tell me,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2205</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I know,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2206</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But the Gamemakers wanted to alter you surgically.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2207</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Haymitch had a huge fight with them over it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2208</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This was the compromise.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2209</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Wait, don&apos;t forget the shoes.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2210</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>girl on fire.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2211</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What do you think?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2212</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I think it&apos;s the best yet,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2213</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I thought it&apos;d be something more... sophisticatedlooking,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2214</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I thought Peeta would like this better,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2215</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Easy, just me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2216</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Let&apos;s have a look at you,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2217</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Good enough.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2218</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But what?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2219</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But nothing.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2220</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How about a hug for luck?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2221</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Listen up.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2222</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>You&apos;re in trouble.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2223</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Word is the Capitol&apos;s furious about you showing them up in the arena.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2224</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The one thing they can&apos;t stand is being laughed at and they&apos;re the joke of Panem,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2225</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So, what?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2226</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Your only defense can be you were so madly in love you weren&apos;t responsible for your actions.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2227</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Got it, sweetheart?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2228</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Got it,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2229</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Did you tell Peeta this?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2230</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Don&apos;t have to,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2231</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He&apos;s already there.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2232</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But you think I&apos;m not?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2233</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Since when does it matter what I think?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2234</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Better take our places.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2235</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>This is your night, sweetheart.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2236</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Enjoy it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2237</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Don&apos;t have to.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2238</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He&apos;s already there.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2239</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why can&apos;t I talk to him?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2240</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Plenty of time for talk when we get home,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2241</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Go to bed, you&apos;re on air at two.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2242</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>big, big, big day!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2243</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The crowd loved you!</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2244</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Congratulations, Katniss.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2245</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How are you faring?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2246</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Fine.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2247</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Nervous about the interview,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2248</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Don&apos;t be.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2249</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We&apos;re going to have a fabulous time,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2250</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I&apos;m not good at talking about myself,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2251</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Nothing you say will be wrong,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2252</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>accident</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2253</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I hardly get to see you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2254</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Haymitch seems bent on keeping us apart.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2255</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes, he&apos;s gotten very responsible lately.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2256</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well, there&apos;s just this and we go home.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2257</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Then he can&apos;t watch us all the time,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2258</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, go ahead and curl up next to him if you want.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2259</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It looked very sweet.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2260</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well, Peeta, we know, from our days in the cave, that it was love at first sight for you from what, age five?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2261</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>From the moment I laid eyes on her,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2262</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But, Katniss, what a ride for you.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2263</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I think the real excitement for the audience was watching you fall for him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2264</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>When did you realize you were in love with him?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2265</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, that&apos;s a hard one...</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2266</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well, I know when it hit me.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2267</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The night when you shouted out his name from that tree,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2268</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes, I guess that was it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2269</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I mean, until that point, I just tried not to think about what my feelings might be, honestly, because it was so confusing and it only made things worse if I actually cared about him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2270</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But then, in the tree, everything changed,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2271</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Why do you think that was?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2272</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Maybe... because for the first time... there was a chance I could keep him,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2273</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So now that you&apos;ve got me, what are you going to do with me?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2274</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Put you somewhere you can&apos;t get hurt.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2275</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>new leg</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2276</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>New leg?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2277</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Oh, no,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2278</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No one told you?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2279</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I haven&apos;t had the chance,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2280</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s my fault,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2281</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Because I used that tourniquet.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2282</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Yes, it&apos;s your fault I&apos;m alive,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2283</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He&apos;s right,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2284</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He&apos;d have bled to death for sure without it.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2285</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Katniss, I know you&apos;ve had a shock, but I&apos;ve got to ask.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2286</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The moment when you pulled out those berries.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2287</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What was going on in your mind... hm?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2288</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I don&apos;t know, I just... couldn&apos;t bear the thought of... being without him.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2289</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Peeta?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2290</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Anything to add?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2291</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2292</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I think that goes for both of us,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2293</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Okay?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2294</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Perfect,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2295</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What&apos;s wrong?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2296</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Nothing,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2297</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Great job, you two.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2298</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Just keep it up in the district until the cameras are gone.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2299</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>We should be okay.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2300</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What&apos;s he mean?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2301</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It&apos;s the Capitol.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2302</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>They didn&apos;t like our stunt with the berries,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2303</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2304</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>What are you talking about?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2305</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It seemed too rebellious.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2306</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So, Haymitch has been coaching me through the last few days.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2307</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So I didn&apos;t make it worse,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2308</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Coaching you?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2309</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But not me,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2310</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>He knew you were smart enough to get it right,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2311</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I didn&apos;t know there was anything to get right,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2312</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>So, what you&apos;re saying is, these last few days and then I guess... back in the arena... that was just some strategy you two worked out.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2313</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2314</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I mean, I couldn&apos;t even talk to him in the arena, could I?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2315</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>But you knew what he wanted you to do, didn&apos;t you?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2316</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Katniss?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2317</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>It was all for the Games,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2318</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>How you acted.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2319</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Not all of it,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2320</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Then how much?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2321</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>No, forget that.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2322</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I guess the real question is what&apos;s going to be left when we get home?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2323</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>I don&apos;t know.</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2324</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>The closer we get to District Twelve, the more confused I get,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2325</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>Well, let me know when you work it out,</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2326</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>One more time?</quotetext>
	</quote>
	<quote>
		<quoteindex>2327</quoteindex>
		<quotetext>For the audience?</quotetext>
	</quote>
